0;30549;"In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;";"Pandemic";2008;4;2;45;45;45;8;"['Medical']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Matt Leacock']";"['Josh Cappel', 'Christian Hanisch', 'Régis Moulun', 'Chris Quilliams', 'Tom Thiel']";"['Z-Man Games', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Albi', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Asterion Press', 'Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)', 'Boardgame Space', 'Brain Games', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'HaKubia', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'Jolly Thinkers', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'MINDOK', 'Nordic Games GmbH', 'Paladium Games', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Quined White Goblin Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games', 'Stratelibri', 'Wargames Club Publishing', 'White Goblin Games', 'Zhiyanjia', 'Ігромаг', 'Взрослые дети']";113532;7.57215;177379;2720;609;9510;5732;2.4058

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";"Carcassonne";2000;5;2;45;30;45;7;"['City Building', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Map Addition', 'Tile Placement']";"['Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Marcel Gröber', 'Doris Matthäus', 'Anne Pätzke', 'Chris Quilliams', 'Franz-Georg Stämmele', 'Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)', 'Brain Games', 'cutia.ro', 'Devir', 'Fantasmagoria', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Grow Jogos e Brinquedos', 'Hobby World', 'Ísöld ehf.', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Midgaard Games', 'MINDOK', 'Möbius Games', 'Monkey Time', 'NeoTroy Games', 'Nordic Games ehf', 'Paper Iyagi', 'Piatnik', 'Ponva d.o.o.', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Smart Ltd', 'Stupor Mundi', 'SuperHeated Neurons', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Venice Connection', 'Ventura Games', 'Z-Man Games']";113428;7.41525;169130;1799;652;7770;7837;1.9026
0;13;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;";"7 Wonders";2010;7;2;30;30;30;10;"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Economic']";"['Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Antoine Bauza']";"['Dimitri Chappuis', 'Miguel Coimbra', 'Etienne Hebinger', 'Cyril Nouvel']";"['Repos Production', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Hobby Japan', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'NeoTroy Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games']";94006;7.71868;126139;1713;982;12448;4896;2.3229

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately.

The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;";"Scythe";2016;5;1;115;90;115;14;"['Economic', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction', 'Territory Building']";"['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Force Commitment', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'King of the Hill', 'Movement Points', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Take That', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource', 'Zone of Control']";"['Jamey Stegmaier']";"['Jakub Rozalski']";"['Stonemaier Games', 'Albi', 'Angry Lion Games', 'Arclight Games', 'CrowD Games', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Feuerland Spiele', 'Fire on Board Jogos', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Geekach Games', 'Ghenos Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Ludofy Creative', 'Maldito Games', 'Matagot', 'Morning', 'PHALANX', 'Playfun Games', ""Surfin' Meeple China""]";69782;8.20057;93772;658;1872;20308;2763;3.4307

If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;";"Splendor";2014;4;2;30;30;30;10;"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Renaissance']";"['Contracts', 'Open Drafting', 'Race', 'Set Collection']";"['Marc André']";"['Pascal Quidault', 'Abbas Amirabadi', 'Mahmoud Arasteh Nasab']";"['Space Cowboys', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Asterion Press', 'Baborka Games', 'Board Game VN', 'Boardgame Space', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'CoolPlay', 'Days of Wonder', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'HaKubia', 'Hobby Japan', 'JD Éditions', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lex Games', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Morapiaf', 'NeoTroy Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games', 'Z-Man Games', 'Бельвіль']";68889;7.43307;98963;922;794;8712;2407;1.7873
0;31260;"Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;";"Agricola";2007;5;1;150;30;150;12;"['Animals', 'Economic', 'Farming']";"['Automatic Resource Growth', 'Closed Drafting', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Klemens Franz']";"['Lookout Games', '999 Games', 'Brain Games', 'Compaya.hu: Gamer Café Kft.', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Funforge', 'Hasbro', 'Hobby Japan', 'Hobby World', 'HomoLudicus', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'MINDOK', 'Smart Ltd', 'Stratelibri', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Ystari Games', 'Z-Man Games']";67969;7.9113;80465;1333;1144;11384;6168;3.6383
0;3076;"In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;";"Puerto Rico";2002;5;3;150;90;150;12;"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Farming']";"['Action Drafting', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Phase Order']";"['Andreas Seyfarth']";"['Harald Lieske', 'Franz Vohwinkel']";"['alea', 'Ravensburger', 'Albi', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lacerta', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'MINDOK', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Stratelibri', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tilsit', 'VAKKO']";67014;7.9506;77537;1414;977;9487;6106;3.2756

You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces.

While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.

0;174430;"Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;";"Gloomhaven";2017;4;1;120;60;120;14;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures']";"['Action Queue', 'Action Retrieval', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Deck Construction', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Legacy Game', 'Modular Board', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Isaac Childres']";"['Alexandr Elichev', 'Josh T.

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&#10;&#10;";"Race for the Galaxy";2007;4;2;60;30;60;12;"['Card Game', 'Civilization', 'Economic', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']";"['Action Drafting', 'Follow', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Turn Order: Role Order', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Thomas Lehmann']";"['Martin Hoffmann', 'Claus Stephan', 'Mirko Suzuki']";"['Rio Grande Games', 'ABACUSSPIELE', 'Albi', 'Ediciones MasQueOca', 'Gabinete Lúdico', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gamesinitaly', 'Ghenos Games', 'Giochix.it', 'Hobby Japan', 'Hobby World', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Matagot', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Portal Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Smart Ltd', 'Wargames Club Publishing', 'YOKA Games', 'Ystari Games']";50821;7.75665;62553;1153;1115;9758;3606;2.9886

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&#10;&#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did.

In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players.

0;161936;"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;";"Pandemic Legacy: Season 1";2015;4;2;60;60;60;13;"['Environmental', 'Medical']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Legacy Game', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Rob Daviau', 'Matt Leacock']";"['Chris Quilliams']";"['Z-Man Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Hobby Japan', 'Jolly Thinkers', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'MINDOK']";47368;8.57665;74158;375;809;12158;1295;2.8286
0;65244;"Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise.

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Other&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;&#10;&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

0;12333;"&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;&#10;&ndash; John F. Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Twilight Struggle";2005;2;2;180;120;180;13;"['Modern Warfare', 'Political', 'Wargame']";"['Action/Event', 'Advantage Token', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Tug of War']";"['Ananda Gupta', 'Jason Matthews']";"['Viktor Csete', 'Rodger B.

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&#10;&#10;&#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica.

0;150376;"&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;";"Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game";2014;5;2;120;60;120;13;"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Horror', 'Zombies']";"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Push Your Luck', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Storytelling', 'Trading', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']";"['Jonathan Gilmour', 'Isaac Vega']";"['David Richards', 'Fernanda Suárez', 'Peter Wocken']";"['Plaid Hat Games', 'Arclight Games', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Cube Factory of Ideas', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Game Harbor', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Gemenot', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Meanbook Games', 'MINDOK', 'Raven Distribution', 'Siam Board Games']";42844;7.51692;58868;1406;791;9019;1566;3.0128

0;11;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";"Bohnanza";1997;7;2;45;45;45;13;"['Card Game', 'Farming', 'Negotiation']";"['Hand Management', 'Melding and Splaying', 'Negotiation', 'Set Collection', 'Trading']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Fréderic Bertrand', 'Marek Bláha', 'Andrea Boekhoff', 'Klemens Franz', 'Oliver Freudenreich', 'Inge George', 'Guido Hoffmann', 'Alexander Jung', 'Harald Lieske', 'Atelier Löwentor', 'Doris Matthäus', 'Björn Pertoft', 'Uwe Rosenberg', 'Johann Rüttinger', 'Barbara Stachuletz', 'Franz Vohwinkel', 'Markus Wagner']";"['AMIGO', '999 Games', 'Brädspel.se', 'Brain Games', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Copag Cards', 'Corfix', 'Fractal Juegos', 'G3', 'Gigamic', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Kikigagne?', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Lookout Games', 'Mercurio', 'Midgaard Games', 'Möbius Games', 'Paper Iyagi', 'PaperGames (III)', 'Piatnik', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Stratelibri', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tempo Games (I)']";41608;7.04267;63001;1041;378;2815;2856;1.6744
0;50;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";"Lost Cities";1999;2;2;30;30;30;10;"['Card Game', 'Exploration']";"['Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Score-and-Reset Game', 'Set Collection']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Vincent Dutrait', 'Michaela Kienle', 'Anke Pohl', 'Thilo Rick', 'Claus Stephan', 'Franz Vohwinkel']";"['KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Competo / Marektoy', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galakta', 'Group SNE', 'IELLO', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Land of Beautiful Mind (سرزمین ذهن زیبا)', 'Laser plus', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Midgaard Games', 'Piatnik', 'Playhouse Ltd', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Stupor Mundi', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tilsit', 'Zvezda', 'گیمِ پندو (Pendo Games)']";41425;7.20412;58530;962;527;4860;3017;1.4866

Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards.

The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Blobs&#10;&#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Star Empire&#10;&#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Machine Cult&#10;&#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Playing Star Realms&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent?

0;170216;"&quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL&quot;&#10;&#10;In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan&rsquo;s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;";"Blood Rage";2015;4;2;90;60;90;14;"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology']";"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Map Reduction', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Eric M.

0;181304;"In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

0;162886;"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;";"Spirit Island";2017;4;1;120;90;120;13;"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Mythology', 'Territory Building']";"['Action Retrieval', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Automatic Resource Growth', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']";"['R.

0;205637;"Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10;";"Arkham Horror: The Card Game";2016;2;1;120;60;120;14;"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Novel-based']";"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck Construction', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Map Deformation', 'Modular Board', 'Push Your Luck', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Stat Check Resolution', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Nate French', 'MJ Newman']";"['Christopher Hosch', 'Marcin Jakubowski', 'Ignacio Bazán Lazcano', 'Henning Ludvigsen', 'Mercedes Opheim', 'Zoe Robinson', 'Evan Simonet']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Arclight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Asterion Press', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Galakta', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Ігромаг']";36264;8.15196;65157;878;762;9125;1168;3.4991

From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host&mdash;you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?&#10;&#10;Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player can take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.&#10;&#10;b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.&#10;&#10;c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";"Everdell";2018;4;1;80;40;80;13;"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Fantasy']";"['Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Ownership', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement']";"['James A.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;";"Magic: The Gathering";1993;2;2;20;20;20;13;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Closed Drafting', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Interrupts', 'Take That']";"['Wizard of Barge', 'Richard Garfield', 'David Iezzi']";"['Victor Adame', 'Miao Aili', 'Randis Albion', 'Rob Alexander', 'James Allen (I)', 'Dave Allsop', 'Scott Altmann', 'Ian Edward Ameling', 'Eric David Anderson', 'Chris J.

Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth.

Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;";"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game";2008;6;3;180;120;180;14;"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Spies/Secret Agents']";"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Role Playing', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Voting']";"['Corey Konieczka']";"['Kevin Childress', 'Brian Schomburg', 'WiL Springer']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Editrice Giochi', 'Galakta', 'Game Harbor', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag']";34696;7.7352;37422;745;838;6312;2142;3.2488

Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&#10;    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.&#10;&#10;";"Concordia";2013;5;2;100;100;100;13;"['Ancient', 'Economic', 'Nautical']";"['Action Retrieval', 'Advantage Token', 'Auction: Dutch', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Movement Points', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Mac Gerdts']";"['Marina Fahrenbach', 'Mac Gerdts', 'Dominik Mayer']";"['PD-Verlag', '999 Games', 'Cranio Creations', 'CrowD Games', 'Ediciones MasQueOca', 'Egmont Polska', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lex Games', 'New Games Order, LLC', 'Playfun Games', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Ystari Games']";34038;8.11788;39452;270;1594;9795;1386;3.0065

Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;";"Eldritch Horror";2013;8;1;240;120;240;14;"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Novel-based', 'Travel']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Role Playing', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Stat Check Resolution', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Corey Konieczka', 'Nikki Valens']";"['Anders Finér', 'David Griffith', 'Ed Mattinian', 'Patrick McEvoy', 'Dallas Mehlhoff', 'Emilio Rodriguez', 'Magali Villeneuve', 'Drew Whitmore']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Arclight Games', 'Asmodee China', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Galakta', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";32867;7.7703;48865;761;717;8162;1582;3.3224

0;171;"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway.

0;1406;"Theme&#10;Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;Cultural impact on rules&#10;Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).&#10;&#10;Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.&#10;&#10;The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    The Landlord's Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;Official&#10;&#10;    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on&#10;    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game&#10;    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Unofficial&#10;&#10;    Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Mafiopoly&#10;    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck&#10;    Final Fantasy Monopoly&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Monopoly";1935;8;2;180;60;180;8;"['Economic', 'Negotiation']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Lose a Turn', 'Ownership', 'Player Elimination', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection', 'Stock Holding', 'Track Movement', 'Trading']";"['(Uncredited)', 'Charles Darrow', 'Elizabeth J.

Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components.

0;103343;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&#10;&#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; Mother of Dragons (2018)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones (2003)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;";"A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)";2011;6;3;240;120;240;14;"['Bluffing', 'Fantasy', 'Negotiation', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Wargame']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Auction: Sealed Bid', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Hand Management', 'Order Counters', 'Player Elimination', ""Prisoner's Dilemma"", 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Christian T.

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&#10;&#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

0;224517;"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&#10;&#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&#10;&#10;New &quot;Sell&quot; system&#10;&#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&#10;&#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&#10;&#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&#10;&#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&#10;&#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass.

After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.&#10;&#10;";"Le Havre";2008;5;1;150;30;150;12;"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Nautical']";"['Automatic Resource Growth', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Loans', 'Ownership', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Worker Placement']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Klemens Franz']";"['Lookout Games', '999 Games', 'CrowD Games', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'Ludofy Creative', 'Maldito Games', 'Mayfair Games', 'MINDOK', 'Stratelibri', 'uplay.it edizioni', 'Ystari Games', 'Z-Man Games']";29142;7.86519;33559;356;1745;9181;1951;3.7324
0;9220;"Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins.

Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5.

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.&#10;&#10;";"Android: Netrunner";2012;2;2;45;45;45;14;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Science Fiction']";"['Action Points', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Race', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Richard Garfield', 'Lukas Litzsinger']";"['Bruno Balixa', 'Ralph Beisner', 'Del Borovic', 'Adam S.

0;148949;"There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&#10;&#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.&#10;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.&#10;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.&#10;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.&#10;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;";"Colt Express";2014;6;2;40;40;40;10;"['American West', 'Fighting', 'Trains']";"['Action Queue', 'Action Retrieval', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Programmed Movement', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Christophe Raimbault']";"['Ian Parovel', 'Jordi Valbuena']";"['Ludonaute', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Brädspel.se', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Fantasmagoria', 'GateOnGames', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'Happy Baobab', 'Hobby Japan', 'Ideal Board Games', 'KADABRA', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Lord of Boards', 'MeepleBR', 'MINDOK', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games']";28278;7.10182;39753;716;431;3655;901;1.8257

For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&#10;&#10;";"Caylus";2005;5;2;150;60;150;12;"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Medieval']";"['Action Queue', 'Ownership', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Turn Order: Pass Order', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement']";"['William Attia']";"['Cyril Demaegd', 'Arnaud Demaegd', 'Mike Doyle (I)']";"['Ystari Games', 'Brain Games', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Esdevium', 'hobbity.eu', 'Hobby Japan', 'HUCH!', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Quined White Goblin Games', 'Rio Grande Games', 'uplay.it edizioni', ""What's Your Game?"", 'White Goblin Games']";27982;7.74207;27731;580;870;5278;3219;3.8009

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

0;182028;"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.&#10;&#10;Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

0;146508;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Expansions were published in this order:&#10;&#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &#226;&#128;&#147; Endurance (2017) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)&#10;&#10;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&#10;&#10;";"T.I.M.E Stories";2015;4;2;90;90;90;12;"['Adventure', 'Mature / Adult', 'Puzzle', 'Science Fiction']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Move Through Deck', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Peggy Chassenet', 'Manuel Rozoy']";"['Ben Carre', 'David Lecossu', 'Pascal Quidault']";"['Space Cowboys', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Asterion Press', 'CrowD Games', 'Delight', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Hobby Japan', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.']";25879;7.46175;38281;1067;683;6789;557;2.5961
0;16992;"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

0;50381;"&quot;A party game for horrible people.&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Card Czar&quot;, choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower).

The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region.

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.&#10;&#10;You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!&#10;&#10;For an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

0;2453;"Blokus (officially pronounced &quot;Block us&quot;) is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.  The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).&#10;&#10;A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).&#10;&#10;There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.&#10;&#10;";"Blokus";2000;4;2;20;20;20;7;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Territory Building']";"['Enclosure', 'Grid Coverage', 'Hand Management', 'Tile Placement']";"['Bernard Tavitian']";"['Alan D.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends.

When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players.

Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy.

Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&#10;&#10;Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards.

Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&#10;&#10;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but a 2011 edition supports up to seven.&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Germany by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.

The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.&#10;&#10;The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.&#10;&#10;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.&#10;&#10;";"Tokaido";2012;5;2;45;45;45;8;"['Travel']";"['End Game Bonuses', 'Set Collection', 'Time Track', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']";"['Antoine Bauza']";"['Xavier Gueniffey Durin']";"['Funforge', 'Asterion Press', 'Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)', 'Devir', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'hobbity.eu', 'Hobby World', 'Jolly Thinkers', 'MINDOK', 'Passport Game Studios', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Pendragon Game Studio', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Zhiyanjia']";23288;6.96039;33691;643;543;5083;787;1.7497

Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen.

(source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely.

Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.&#10;&#10;Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.&#10;&#10;You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation.

0;77423;"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios.

Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.&#10;&#10;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;";"Star Wars: Imperial Assault";2014;5;1;120;60;120;14;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Grid Movement', 'Line of Sight', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Square Grid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Justin Kemppainen', 'Corey Konieczka', 'Jonathan Ying']";"['Arden Beckwith', 'Christopher Burdett', 'Rovina Cai', 'Lucas Durham', 'Joel Hustak', 'Michal Ivan', 'David Kegg', 'Henning Ludvigsen', 'Brynn Metheney', 'Vlad Ricean', 'Ryan Valle', 'Ben Zweifel']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Galakta', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World']";22655;7.98734;38697;676;819;6782;870;3.3034

The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens.

0;28720;"Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Brass: Lancashire";2007;4;2;120;60;120;14;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Transportation']";"['Hand Management', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Market', 'Network and Route Building', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based']";"['Martin Wallace']";"['Gavan Brown', 'Lina Cossette', 'Peter Dennis', 'David Forest', 'Eckhard Freytag', 'Damien Mammoliti']";"['Roxley', 'Warfrog Games', 'Arclight Games', 'BoardM Factory', 'Conclave Editora', 'CrowD Games', 'Eagle-Gryphon Games', 'FRED Distribution, Inc.', 'Funforge', 'Ghenos Games', 'Giant Roc', 'Maldito Games', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'PHALANX', 'Wargames Club Publishing', 'White Goblin Games']";21968;8.18555;28841;517;934;5576;1542;3.8619

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;";"Village";2011;4;2;90;60;90;12;"['Farming', 'Medieval']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Set Collection', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']";"['Inka Brand', 'Markus Brand']";"['Dennis Lohausen']";"['eggertspiele', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Fantasmagoria', 'Fire on Board Jogos', 'Gigamic', 'hobbity.eu', 'Hobby Japan', 'KADABRA', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Ludicus', 'Ludonova', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Plan B Games', 'Stronghold Games', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tasty Minstrel Games', 'uplay.it edizioni', 'Zvezda']";21749;7.50706;28077;469;682;3852;1145;3.0716

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins.

Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game.

Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order.

And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants.

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&#10;&#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&#10;&#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.&#10;&#10;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.&#10;&#10;There are many more ways to lose, however.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;).

The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas &#10;2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board &amp; tiles, redesigned stocks &amp; money&#10;2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition.

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may build only one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card, and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes their turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, then lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&#10;&#10;";"Thurn and Taxis";2006;4;2;60;60;60;10;"['Post-Napoleonic', 'Transportation']";"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['Andreas Seyfarth', 'Karen Seyfarth']";"['Michael Menzel']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Hobby World', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'MINDOK', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Smart Ltd']";19056;7.09664;21413;520;458;2129;1832;2.2587

0;118048;"Theme and overview:&#10;&#10;Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards).

You play as Friday, and when Robinson Crusoe crashes his ship on your island, your peaceful times are disturbed. You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.&#10;&#10;Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player's deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck.

0;1294;"For versions of Clue that feature the new character Dr. Orchid, please use this Clue page.&#10;&#10;The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation. If correct, the player wins, but if incorrect, the player must return the cards to the file without revealing them and may no longer make suggestions or accusations. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players.

0;15512;"Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";"Diamant";2005;8;3;30;30;30;8;"['Adventure', 'Bluffing', 'Exploration']";"['Move Through Deck', 'Push Your Luck', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Bruno Faidutti', 'Alan R.

With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of Catan, while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Twilight Imperium: Third Edition";2005;6;3;240;180;240;14;"['Civilization', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Wargame']";"['Action Points', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Follow', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Tile Placement', 'Trading', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']";"['Christian T.

However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces.

In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.&#10;Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. &#10;Each Season is divided into five phases: &#10;1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, &#10;2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, &#10;3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,&#10;4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and &#10;5) Seasonal Cleanup.&#10;&#10;As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game.

While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.

0;926;"Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10;";"Catan: Cities & Knights";1998;4;3;90;90;90;12;"['Expansion for Base-game', 'Medieval', 'Negotiation']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Trading']";"['Klaus Teuber']";"['Volkan Baga', 'Tanja Donner', 'Jason Hawkins', 'Harald Lieske', 'Michael Menzel', 'Klaus Teuber', 'Franz Vohwinkel', 'Stephen Graham Walsh']";"['KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Asmodee', 'Brain Games', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Catan Studio', 'danspil', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galakta', 'Giochi Uniti', 'GP Games', 'HaKubia', 'Hobby World', 'Igroljub', 'Ísöld ehf.', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Laser plus', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Mayfair Games', 'Piatnik', 'Smart Ltd', 'Spilbræt.dk', 'SuperHeated Neurons', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tilsit', 'TRY SOFT', 'Vennerød Forlag AS']";18517;7.45144;38195;480;237;1470;1371;2.8972

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&#10;&#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&#10;&#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.&#10;&#10;Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;";"Captain Sonar";2016;8;2;60;45;60;14;"['Deduction', 'Fighting', 'Nautical', 'Real-time']";"['Grid Movement', 'Hidden Movement', 'Line Drawing', 'Real-Time', 'Role Playing', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation', 'Team-Based Game']";"['Roberto Fraga', 'Yohan Lemonnier']";"['Ervin', 'Sabrina Tobal']";"['Matagot', 'Asmodee', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Bureau de Juegos', 'Conclave Editora', 'CrowD Games', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lex Games', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Pendragon Game Studio', ""Surfin' Meeple China""]";18438;7.5417;25594;517;643;6105;321;2.1838

0;37904;"Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.

0;92415;"Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs.

0;28023;"Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;";"Jamaica";2007;6;2;60;30;60;8;"['Nautical', 'Pirates', 'Racing']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Malcolm Braff', 'Bruno Cathala', 'Sébastien Pauchon']";"['Mathieu Leyssenne']";"['GameWorks SàRL', 'Space Cowboys', 'Asterion Press', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Popcorn Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.']";17993;7.06419;24883;439;735;4672;800;1.6562

0;233078;"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition";2017;6;3;480;240;480;14;"['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Exploration', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Wargame']";"['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Follow', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'King of the Hill', 'Modular Board', 'Race', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Trading', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Voting']";"['Dane Beltrami', 'Corey Konieczka', 'Christian T.

Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.&#10;&#10;Each trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you&rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game.

0;144733;"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;";"Russian Railroads";2013;4;2;120;90;120;12;"['Industry / Manufacturing', 'Trains']";"['End Game Bonuses', 'Worker Placement']";"['Helmut Ohley', 'Leonhard ""Lonny"" Orgler']";"['Martin Hoffmann', 'Claus Stephan']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Hobby World', 'MINDOK', 'Z-Man Games']";16535;7.75423;15493;216;931;3928;807;3.4077
0;34219;"THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy.

Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. There is a popular house rule that allows the trading of goods between players in exchange for other goods and the ability to chose where a tile is placed.

In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure.

The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;";"Ingenious";2004;4;1;45;30;45;8;"['Abstract Strategy']";"['Hand Management', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Pattern Building', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Michaela Kienle', 'Fabio Maiorana', 'Scott Nicely', 'Simone Peruzzi', 'Nick Whyles']";"['KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Brädspel.se', 'Brain Games', 'Damm / Egmont', 'Devir', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Egmont Litas', 'Esdevium', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Green Board Game Co.', 'Hobby Japan', 'Hobby World', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Kärnan', 'Kirjalito', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Laser plus', 'Litor', 'Mass Games', 'MINDOK', 'Nexus Editrice', 'Piatnik', 'Sophisticated Games', 'Stupor Mundi', 'Tilsit', 'White Goblin Games']";16370;7.11022;20139;571;319;2043;1380;1.9123

All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play).

In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau.

0;188;"By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;The earliest mention of Go (&#229;&#156;&#141;&#230;&#163;&#139; (w&eacute;i q&iacute;)- &quot;surrounding game&quot;) appears in the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17&times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).&#10;&#10;A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente.&#10;&#10;";"Go";-2200;2;2;180;30;180;8;"['Abstract Strategy']";"['Enclosure', 'Square Grid']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['(Uncredited)', 'Barbro Hennius', 'Norman Sommer']";"['(Public Domain)', '(Self-Published)', '(Unknown)', '3M', 'Alga', 'Ariel Productions Ltd', 'The Avalon Hill Game Co', 'Barnes & Noble', 'Borras Plana S.A.', 'Brybelly', 'Carl Weible KG', 'Carlton Books', 'Cathay', 'Cayro, the games', 'CHH Games', 'Copp Clark Publishing Company', 'Creative Crafthouse', 'Crisloid', 'Dal Negro', 'Dilemma Games', 'Dujardin', 'Dynamic Games / Dynamic Design Industries', 'E.S.

0;155821;"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;";"Inis";2016;4;2;90;60;90;14;"['Card Game', 'Exploration', 'Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology']";"['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'King of the Hill', 'Map Addition', 'Modular Board', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Christian Martinez']";"['Dimitri Bielak', 'Jim FitzPatrick']";"['Matagot', 'Bureau de Juegos', 'Buró', 'Gen-X Games', 'Giant Roc', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'Hobby Japan', 'Lavka Games', 'Lord of Boards', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Portal Games', ""Surfin' Meeple"", ""Surfin' Meeple China""]";15959;7.81883;21124;243;1288;7704;428;2.8785

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.&#10;&#10;Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.&#10;&#10;Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.&#10;&#10;As a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.&#10;&#10;";"Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game";2013;4;2;30;30;30;13;"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Video Game Theme']";"['Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"[""Johnny O'Neal"", ""Chris O'Neal"", ""Christopher O'Neal""]";"['Beau Buckley', 'Francisco Coda', 'Katrina Guillermo', 'Kyle Merritt', 'David Nyari', 'Alexander Olsen', 'Andres Sanabria']";"['Brotherwise Games', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fever Games', 'GaGa Games', 'Muduko', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Redbox Editora (Redbox)', 'Trefl Joker Line']";15401;6.27705;31657;1066;100;1256;475;1.8484

On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck).

By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&#10;&#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring.

Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Attack&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.&#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other.

Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth.

Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use.

In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives&#10;&#10;";"Above and Below";2015;4;2;90;90;90;13;"['Adventure', 'City Building', 'Economic', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Farming', 'Negotiation']";"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Set Collection', 'Storytelling', 'Trading', 'Turn Order: Progressive']";"['Ryan Laukat']";"['Ryan Laukat']";"['Red Raven Games', 'Arclight Games', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Conclave Editora', 'Devir', 'dV Giochi', 'Lavka Games', 'Lucky Duck Games', 'MYBG Co., Ltd.', 'Mysterious Island Games', 'Schwerkraft-Verlag']";14577;7.38683;22577;502;642;4965;391;2.5217
0;521;"Crokinole is a dexterity traditional game.&#10;&#10;Crokinole is played on a circular wooden board, with wooden circular disks as playing pieces.&#10;&#10;Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers.  Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board.  Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.&#10;&#10;As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.&#10;&#10;Players must position their disk on the start of each of their turns in their quadrant in front of them, touching the outer scoring ring boundary.&#10;&#10;If there are no opponent's disks on the board, they must aim for the center of the board.&#10;&#10;If there is an opponent's disk on the board, they must aim and hit an opponent's piece first, either directly, or by a carrom shot.&#10;&#10;The center recessed hole is worth 20 points, and disks are removed and scored at the end of the round if they land in the center hole.&#10;&#10;Disks that are outside the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, or are touching the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, are removed from play for the round.&#10;&#10;Scoring is by cancellation scoring (e.g. Player/Side One scores 250, and Player/Side Two scores 225, Player/Side One scores 25.)&#10;&#10;It is usually played as a two-player game or as a four-player game with partners.&#10;&#10;Play is to a set score, usually the first player/side to 100.&#10;&#10;Alternately, play is set at &quot;Match Scoring&quot; where the winner of each round scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A &quot;game&quot; is usually played to four rounds, with the winner of each &quot;game&quot; being the one with the most points. The numbers of &quot;games&quot; in a match is set by the tournament.&#10;&#10;The World Crokinole Championship uses &quot;Match Scoring.&quot;&#10;&#10;";"Crokinole";1876;4;2;30;30;30;8;"['Action / Dexterity']";"['Flicking', 'Team-Based Game']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['Allison Litchfield', 'Orlando Ramirez']";"['(Public Domain)', '(Unknown)', 'BrownCastle Games', 'Carrom Company', 'Cogitate Games', 'Crokinole World', 'Felsberger', 'Ferti', 'Gameland 游戏大陆', 'Hilinski Brothers', 'Industries Prince, Inc.', 'John Jaques of London', 'M.

U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers &ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark &ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;handbuilding&quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.&#10;&#10;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.&#10;&#10;";"Lewis & Clark: The Expedition";2013;5;1;120;120;120;14;"['American West', 'Exploration']";"['Action Retrieval', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Race', 'Resource to Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Track Movement', 'Worker Placement']";"['Cédrick Chaboussit']";"['Vincent Dutrait']";"['Ludonaute', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'EVA GAMES', 'GateOnGames', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hunter & Cron', 'Maldito Games', 'MeepleBR', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'REXhry']";14430;7.47241;17619;472;587;3538;713;3.3394

0;27627;"Theme:&#10;&#10;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Talisman: Revised 4th Edition";2007;6;2;90;90;90;13;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Role Playing', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['John Goodenough', 'Robert Harris']";"['Massimiliano Bertolini', 'Marjorie Davis', 'Ralph Horsley', 'Jeremy McHugh', 'WiL Springer', 'Sean Turtle', 'Teejay Ralph Villahermosa']";"['Black Industries', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Devir', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Ediciones MasQueOca', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Galakta', 'Game Harbor', 'Games Workshop Ltd.', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby Game Mall', 'Hobby Japan', 'Mandoo Games', 'Matagot', 'Monkey Time', 'Nexus Editrice', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Smart Ltd']";14350;6.5164;22120;542;194;1723;850;2.1812

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points.

If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;";"Tichu";1991;4;4;60;60;60;10;"['Card Game']";"['Hand Management', 'Ladder Climbing', 'Predictive Bid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']";"['Urs Hostettler']";"['Kerri Aitken', 'Christine Alcouffe', 'Res Brandenberger', 'François Bruel', 'Philippe Guérin', 'Urs Hostettler', 'Chris Quilliams', 'Valerie Vekemans', 'Franz Vohwinkel']";"['Fata Morgana Spiele', '999 Games', 'ABACUSSPIELE', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'G3', 'GP Games', 'Hobby World', 'HomoLudicus', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Playhouse Ltd', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'TIKI Editions', 'uplay.it edizioni', 'Vennerød Forlag AS']";14312;7.5778;22169;331;288;1942;941;2.3358

The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play.

The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction.

Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table.

Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.

Each season, players will get to see the heroes and events to come in the following season.  Thus allowing them to prepare.&#10;&#10;At the end of each season (after the first), heroes will be allocated to each player according to their level of evil.  Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves.  Each hero has their own power for which the player needs to prepare for.&#10;Finally, at the end of each year, the heroes will travel down into the dungeon to fight.&#10;&#10;Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.&#10;&#10;";"Dungeon Lords";2009;4;2;90;90;90;12;"['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Humor']";"['Action Queue', 'Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']";"['Vlaada Chvátil']";"['David Cochard']";"['Czech Games Edition', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'IELLO', 'MINDOK', 'One Moment Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Stratelibri', 'Z-Man Games']";13407;7.37926;15135;488;466;3061;938;3.5682

0;2452;"A tower building game.&#10;&#10;Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;&#10;&#10;According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;";"Jenga";1983;8;1;20;20;20;6;"['Action / Dexterity', 'Party Game']";"['Physical Removal', 'Single Loser Game', 'Stacking and Balancing']";"['Leslie Scott']";"['Tony Moore']";"['(Unknown)', 'Barnes & Noble', 'Borras Plana S.A.', 'Brädspel.se', 'Brinquedos Junges', 'Cayro, the games', 'Chad Valley Co Ltd.', 'Challenge Master Game Co Ltd', 'Creative Crafthouse', 'Dal Negro', 'Early Learning Centre', 'Estrela', 'Fabbri Editore', 'Flying Tiger Copenhagen', 'Full Base Union Enterprise Co., Ltd.', 'Fundex', 'Go!

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;";"Welcome to the Dungeon";2013;4;2;30;30;30;10;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Memory', 'Player Elimination', 'Push Your Luck']";"['Hisanori Hiraoka', 'Masato Uesugi']";"['Dimitri Chappuis', 'Bastien Grivet', 'Paul Mafayon', 'Igor Polouchine', 'Masato Uesugi']";"['IELLO', 'Oink Games', '2 Pionki', 'BoardM Factory', 'Bureau de Juegos', 'Devir', 'Geekach Games', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World', 'I Was Game', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lex Games', 'Portal Games', 'Redbox Editora (Redbox)', 'Reflexshop', 'REXhry', 'uplay.it edizioni']";13057;6.57057;23124;650;147;1560;343;1.2362

After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it's back into the fight!&#10;&#10;";"Space Hulk: Death Angel – The Card Game";2010;6;1;60;30;60;13;"['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction']";"['Action Queue', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Move Through Deck', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Corey Konieczka']";"['Matt Bradbury', 'Kevin Chin', 'Víctor Pérez Corbella', 'John Gravato', 'Zach Graves', 'Nick Ingeneri', 'Héctor Ortiz', 'Brad Rigney', 'Silver Saaremäel', 'Daniel Xio']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasiapelit', 'Galakta', 'Games Workshop Ltd.', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World', 'Smart Ltd', 'Stupor Mundi', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";12834;6.99917;22384;790;245;1578;775;2.4194
0;25554;"Rio Grande Games' description:&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...&#10;&#10;After 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over. The maitre who has made the most of his cards and has garnered the most prestige points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Description from Alea.&#10;&#10;This game is #11 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     6-/7-player expansion (unofficial)&#10;     Treasure Chest&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Notre Dame Express (unofficial)&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Notre Dame";2007;5;2;75;45;75;10;"['Economic', 'Renaissance']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement']";"['Stefan Feld']";"['Harald Lieske']";"['alea', 'Ravensburger', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Rio Grande Games']";12824;7.32672;12888;324;433;1886;1143;2.7454

0;2397;"Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.&#10;&#10;It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;";"Backgammon";-3000;2;2;30;30;30;8;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Dice']";"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Track Movement']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['(Uncredited)', 'Willem Cornelisz Duyster', 'Christian Lacroix']";"['(Public Domain)', '(Unknown)', '3M', 'ABRA', 'Alga', 'Ariel Productions Ltd', 'Arrow Games Ltd', 'ASS Altenburger Spielkarten', 'Basic Fun, Inc.', 'Bello Games New York, Inc.', 'Berliner Spielkarten', 'Bisonte', 'Blatz', 'Brio AB', 'Bütehorn Spiele (Buchholz Verlag)', 'Cardinal', 'Caribou Mountaineering, Inc.', 'Carlit', 'Cathay', 'Cayro, the games', 'Chad Valley Co Ltd.', 'Chadwick Miller Inc.', 'Challenge Master Game Co Ltd', 'CHH Games', 'Classic Toys', 'Creative Crafthouse', 'Crisloid', 'Croner', 'Daells Varehus', 'Dal Negro', 'Deuce', 'Dilemma Games', 'Dino Toys s. r. o.', 'Diset S.

Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

0;172386;"In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I expected, the East African Company's network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...&quot;&#10;&#10;Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 18th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.&#10;&#10;Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.&#10;&#10;";"Mombasa";2015;4;2;150;75;150;12;"['Economic']";"['Action Queue', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Investment', 'Open Drafting', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Stock Holding', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Alexander Pfister']";"['Klemens Franz', 'Andreas Resch']";"['eggertspiele', 'Albi', 'Arclight Games', 'Bright World Games', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Do it games', 'The Game Master BV', 'Gigamic', 'Lacerta', 'LudoSentinel', 'MeepleBR', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'R&R Games', 'uplay.it edizioni']";12177;7.86821;14048;181;751;3598;611;3.892
0;176396;"Each player builds their own metropolis in Quadropolis (first announced as City Mania), but they're competing with one another for the shops, parks, public services and other structures to be placed in them.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, and in each round players first lay out tiles for the appropriate round at random on a 5x5 grid. Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).&#10;&#10;When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score.

Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.&#10;&#10;In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began.

Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.&#10;&#10;Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.&#10;&#10;If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4.

To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements. In one location, they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories, sponsored buildings, influenced characters, or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards.&#10;&#10;Family members are not identical. At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...&#10;&#10;You can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn't prayed enough will suffer hard penalties. After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;The New Edition includes:&#10;- Lorenzo il Magnifico: Houses of Renaissance&#10;- the 24 basic cards of Lorenzo il Magnifico: The Pazzi Conspiracy (but not the 24 KSE cards) &#10;- Lorenzo Il Magnifico: Promo Visconti/Della Scala&#10;- Lorenzo il Magnifico: New Leaders (Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, Raffaello Sanzio)&#10;- Lorenzo il Magnifico: New Leaders #2 (Carlo VIII, Iacopo Salviati)&#10;Any other promos are not included.&#10;&#10;FAQ: http://www.craniocreations.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lorenzo_HoR_tPC_Cheatsheet_FAQ_high_res_v1.1_compressed-1.pdf&#10;&#10;";"Lorenzo il Magnifico";2016;4;2;120;60;120;12;"['Renaissance']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement with Dice Workers']";"['Flaminia Brasini', 'Virginio Gigli', 'Simone Luciani']";"['Klemens Franz', 'Andreas Resch']";"['Cranio Creations', 'Albi', 'Albi Polska', 'Angry Lion Games', 'Atalia', 'CrowD Games', 'Game Harbor', 'HeidelBÄR Games', 'Maldito Games', 'MeepleBR', 'テンデイズゲームズ(TendaysGames)']";11785;7.87484;14728;194;607;2944;365;3.2959

Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts.

(Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon,&quot; but survival alone may not win you the game.&#10;&#10;";"In the Year of the Dragon";2007;5;2;100;75;100;12;"['Economic', 'Medieval']";"['Action Drafting', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Stefan Feld']";"['Harald Lieske', 'Michael Menzel']";"['alea', 'Ravensburger', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Rio Grande Games']";11431;7.32042;10249;263;439;1914;944;3.0964

0;9216;"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;";"Goa";2004;4;2;90;90;90;12;"['Economic', 'Farming', 'Nautical', 'Renaissance']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Auction: Once Around', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks']";"['Rüdiger Dorn']";"['Oliver Freudenreich']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'HomoLudicus', 'Lacerta', 'Lookout Games', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Z-Man Games']";11214;7.57099;11134;277;834;2783;1139;3.3731

After choosing a monster, each player takes the eight Evolution cards associated with that monster, shuffles those cards, and creates a personal deck.

Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play.

0;257501;"From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen&mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!&#10;&#10;Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet&rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.&#10;&#10;This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!&#10;&#10;Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them&mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival&rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"KeyForge: Call of the Archons";2018;2;2;45;15;45;14;"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Hand Management', 'Take That']";"['Richard Garfield']";"[]";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Asterion Press', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.']";10582;7.17741;15993;450;89;1202;199;2.4623

Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents.

Yet while the war for Westeros rages, grave dangers gather in the cold North, and an ancient enemy is gaining momentum in the distant East.&#10;&#10;In A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, players take control of one of the great Houses of Westeros. Via resource management, diplomacy, and cunning, they seek to win dominance over the land. Players must give orders to armies, control important characters, gather resources for the coming winter, and survive the onslaught of their enemies.

0;70149;"In Ora et Labora (Latin for 'Pray and work'), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&#10;&#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.&#10;&#10;";"Ora et Labora";2011;4;1;180;60;180;13;"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Medieval', 'Religious', 'Territory Building']";"['Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Klemens Franz']";"['Lookout Games', '999 Games', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Game Harbor', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'uplay.it edizioni', 'Z-Man Games']";10370;7.69892;13167;259;981;3626;656;3.8918

0;53953;"For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Thunderstone";2009;5;1;60;60;60;12;"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']";"['Mike Elliott']";"['Jason Engle']";"['Alderac Entertainment Group', 'Arclight Games', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Hobby World', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Stratelibri', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";10335;6.92545;10861;637;192;1428;625;2.504
0;9609;"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).&#10;&#10;Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition)";2015;6;2;90;45;90;14;"['Science Fiction']";"['Action Retrieval', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Role Order']";"['Bruno Cathala', 'Bruno Faidutti']";"['Andrew Bosley', 'Samuel R.

As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;";"Pandemic: The Cure";2014;5;2;30;30;30;8;"['Dice', 'Environmental', 'Medical']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Matt Leacock']";"['Bernard Bittler', 'Philippe Guérin', 'Chris Quilliams']";"['Z-Man Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Hobby Japan', 'Lacerta']";10078;7.27453;15795;329;396;2488;315;2.0571

0;1115;"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards. The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.&#10;&#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:&#10;&#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).&#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)&#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).&#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). &#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)&#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).&#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).&#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).&#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).&#10;&#10;Poker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.&#10;&#10;In Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;In Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;Currently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.&#10;&#10;No-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.  There is then another betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;";"Poker";1810;10;2;60;60;60;12;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game']";"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Player Elimination', 'Set Collection']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['(Uncredited)', 'René Goscinny', 'Albert Uderzo']";"['(Public Domain)', '(Self-Published)', '(Unknown)', 'AG Müller (AGMüller)', 'ASS Altenburger Spielkarten', 'Basic Fun, Inc.', 'Berliner Spielkarten', 'Cardinal', 'Coach House Games, Inc.', 'Coca-Cola', 'Editions ATLAS', 'Endless Games (I)', 'Excalibur Electronics', 'F.X.

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick.

If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round.

You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds.

Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you'll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on.

0;2425;"Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.&#10;&#10;Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&#10;&#10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).&#10;&#10;In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised).&#10;&#10;Some history of the published versions of the game:&#10;1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.&#10;1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.&#10;1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.&#10;1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

0;30869;"Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.

Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player.

0;2398;"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;";"Cribbage";1630;4;2;30;30;30;10;"['Card Game']";"['Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck']";"['Sir John Suckling']";"[]";"['(Public Domain)', '(Unknown)', '5th Peg', 'Acme Ruler Company', 'Are-Jay Game Company', 'Bello Games New York, Inc.', 'C.R.

0;27708;"From the author:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;&#10;&#10;";"1960: The Making of the President";2007;2;2;120;90;120;12;"['Political']";"['Action/Event', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Hand Management']";"['Christian Leonhard', 'Jason Matthews']";"['Josh Cappel', 'Donal Hegarty', 'Rodger B.

Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a ranger, rogue, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.&#10;&#10;";"Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game";2010;5;1;60;60;60;12;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Rob Heinsoo', 'Peter Lee', 'Mike Mearls', 'Bill Slavicsek']";"['Jesper Ejsing', 'Jason Engle', 'Andrew Hou', 'Warren Mahy', 'Wayne Reynolds', 'Keven Smith']";"['Wizards of the Coast']";8880;6.97944;15991;512;344;2136;598;2.505

0;140;"Pit is an open-outcry commodity trading game. The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&#10;&#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.&#10;&#10;Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.&#10;&#10;";"Pit";1903;8;3;90;30;90;7;"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Negotiation', 'Party Game', 'Real-time']";"['Set Collection', 'Trading']";"['Edgar Cayce', 'Harry Gavitt', 'George S.

0;256960;"In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.&#10;&#10;In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.&#10;&#10;To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.&#10;&#10;After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions.

After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;2015 edition:&#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem.

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations.

0;10;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";"Elfenland";1998;6;2;60;60;60;10;"['Fantasy', 'Travel']";"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement']";"['Alan R.

0;163602;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;";"XCOM: The Board Game";2015;4;1;120;60;120;14;"['Real-time', 'Science Fiction', 'Video Game Theme']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Eric M.

In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources&#10;     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities&#10;     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units&#10;     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors.

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&#10;&#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home.

But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely &mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring.

0;24508;"In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;";"Taluva";2006;4;2;45;45;45;8;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Territory Building']";"['Layering', 'Race', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']";"['Marcel-André Casasola Merkle']";"['Manuel Casasola Merkle', 'Xavier Gueniffey Durin', 'Julien Le Faucheur', 'Marcel-André Casasola Merkle']";"['Hans im Glück', 'Cranio Creations', 'Ferti', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Schmidt Spiele']";8254;7.15297;8268;177;539;2238;689;2.2642

At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&#10;&#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&#10;&#10;";"Pirate's Cove";2002;5;3;90;60;90;8;"['Adventure', 'Fighting', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Paul Randles', 'Daniel Stahl']";"['Cyrille Daujean', 'Julien Delval', 'Swen Papenbrock', 'Markus Wagner']";"['Days of Wonder', 'AMIGO', 'Lautapelit.fi']";8116;6.56837;10500;443;266;1313;792;2.0051

The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action. They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another. Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible.&#10;&#10;As players take actions, they research new technologies that come in four levels. Each technology is one of four types (scientific, economic, military, commercial), and higher-level technologies must match one of the types of tech that lead into it. Thus, players create their own technology tree in each game, using these actions to increase their military strength, to jump to different habitable exoplanetary systems, to colonize those systems, to boost their resource production, to develop android tech that allows growth without population, and more.&#10;&#10;";"Beyond the Sun";2020;4;2;120;60;120;14;"['Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']";"['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Events', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Worker Placement']";"['Dennis K.

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices.

0;105134;"This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.&#10;&#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&#10;&#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&#10;&#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&#10;&#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.&#10;&#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&#10;&#10;";"Risk Legacy";2011;5;3;60;60;60;13;"['Science Fiction', 'Wargame']";"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Legacy Game', 'Open Drafting', 'Player Elimination', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Rob Daviau', 'Chris Dupuis']";"['Richard Edwards', 'Jason Taylor']";"['Hasbro', 'Avalon Hill', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Wizards of the Coast']";8033;7.39792;14281;212;313;2674;282;2.5922
0;11170;"This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.&#10;&#10;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options.

The game ends when someone completes seven objectives.&#10;&#10;";"Rise of Augustus";2013;6;2;30;30;30;8;"['Ancient', 'Card Game']";"['Bingo', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection']";"['Paolo Mori']";"['Vincent Dutrait']";"['Hurrican', 'Brädspel.se', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Vennerød Forlag AS']";7946;6.73835;9901;397;145;895;412;1.6383

You can earn points in the short-term by claiming shops in the city or by sending your traders to the caravan. You can also improve your infrastructure by constructing buildings that improve your actions or picking up action cards that give you extra options.

0;36946;"Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there&rsquo;s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.&#10;&#10;If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won.&#10;&#10;";"Red November";2008;8;1;120;60;120;13;"['Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Nautical']";"['Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Time Track']";"['Bruno Faidutti', 'Jef Gontier']";"['Bruno Faidutti', 'Jef Gontier', 'Christophe Madura']";"['Arclight Games', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasiapelit', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Galakta', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Nexus Editrice', 'Ubik', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";7921;6.2932;11259;623;156;1136;618;2.0728

The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.&#10;&#10;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).&#10;&#10;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.&#10;&#10;Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.&#10;&#10;Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.&#10;&#10;";"Runebound: Second Edition";2005;6;2;240;120;240;12;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Role Playing', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Darrell Hardy', 'Martin Wallace']";"['Andy Brase', 'Jesper Ejsing', 'Louis Frank', 'John Goodenough', 'Kurt Miller', 'John Moriarty', 'Scott Nicely', 'Ben Prenevost', 'Hian Rodriguez', 'Kevin Senft', 'Kieran Yanner']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', '(Unknown)', 'Arclight Games', 'Beacon Multimedia S.A.', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Galakta', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby World', 'Nexus Editrice', 'PS-Games', 'Ubik']";7921;6.88187;10435;466;175;959;819;2.6777

There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.&#10;&#10;Play is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices. The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market). And, the player with the largest &quot;keep&quot; (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game.

0;13004;"The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;";"The Downfall of Pompeii";2004;4;2;45;45;45;10;"['Ancient']";"['Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Tile Placement']";"['Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Oliver Freudenreich', 'Guido Hoffmann']";"['AMIGO', 'Maldito Games', 'Mayfair Games']";7909;7.14547;9090;192;401;1648;645;1.8465
0;915;"Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;";"Mystery of the Abbey";1995;6;3;90;60;90;8;"['Deduction', 'Medieval', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Religious']";"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Set Collection']";"['Bruno Faidutti', 'Serge Laget']";"['Cyrille Daujean', 'Julien Delval', 'Emmanuel Roudier']";"['Days of Wonder', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Giochi Uniti', 'KDS Distribuzione (Italy)', 'MultiSim']";7892;6.53705;9660;310;373;1650;709;2.2031

The first player to have used all of their animals wins.&#10;&#10;This game, intended for children, is equally popular with adults.&#10;&#10;";"Animal Upon Animal";2005;4;2;15;15;15;4;"['Action / Dexterity', 'Animals', ""Children's Game""]";"['Dice Rolling', 'Stacking and Balancing']";"['Klaus Miltenberger']";"['Michael Bayer', 'Klaus Miltenberger']";"['HABA', 'Conclave Editora', 'Hobby World', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.']";7826;6.80261;12371;161;202;1056;385;1.0416

A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police! Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.&#10;&#10;The Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)&#10;     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)&#10;     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)&#10;     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)&#10;     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies! Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player's hand must be paid 1F each. After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs.

The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so.

The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.

0;101721;"What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?&#10;&#10;Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!&#10;&#10;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&#10;&#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&#10;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&#10;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&#10;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&#10;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&#10;&#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game.

0;250458;"China, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.&#10;&#10;The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.&#10;&#10;G&ugrave;g&#197;&#141;ng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor.

On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;";"Terror in Meeple City";2013;4;2;45;45;45;8;"['Action / Dexterity', 'Horror']";"['Area Movement', 'Flicking', 'Set Collection', 'Stacking and Balancing', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Antoine Bauza', 'Ludovic Maublanc']";"['Pierô']";"['Repos Production']";7365;6.84167;11483;400;315;1581;319;1.4796
0;155695;"Age of War is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";"Age of War";2014;6;2;30;15;30;14;"['Dice', 'Medieval']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection', 'Take That']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Simon Eckert', 'Tony Foti']";"['Arclight Games', 'cutia.ro', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Precisamente']";7321;6.45308;11165;230;112;824;269;1.1115
0;71;"Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.&#10;&#10;";"Civilization";1980;7;2;360;360;360;12;"['Ancient', 'Civilization', 'Economic', 'Negotiation']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Trading', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based']";"['Francis Tresham']";"['Ed Dovey', 'Charles Kibler', 'Rodger B.

0;22827;"Publisher blurb&#10;&#10;Including a total of 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, Starcraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board of varying sizes, which guarantees a new experience each and every game. An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.&#10;&#10;Description&#10;&#10;In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).&#10;&#10;Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.&#10;&#10;Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.&#10;&#10;Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.&#10;&#10;&quot;Reimplements&quot;&#10;&#10;     StarCraft (video game)&#10;&#10;&#10;";"StarCraft: The Board Game";2007;6;2;240;180;240;12;"['Civilization', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Territory Building', 'Video Game Theme', 'Wargame']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Modular Board', 'Order Counters', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Corey Konieczka', 'Christian T.

If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.&#10;&#10;The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.&#10;&#10;";"Cthulhu: Death May Die";2019;5;1;120;90;120;14;"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Novel-based']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Rob Daviau', 'Eric M.

Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun.

Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 12. On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable &quot;Skip-bo&quot; wildcard.&#10;&#10;Skip-bo is based on Traditional Card Games: Spite and Malice.&#10;&#10;";"Skip-Bo";1967;6;2;20;20;20;8;"['Card Game']";"['Hand Management']";"['Hazel ""Skip"" Bowman ']";"[]";"['AMIGO', 'Gibsons', 'International Games', 'Mattel, Inc.', 'The Skip-bo Company', 'Tomy', 'Waddingtons']";7091;5.54071;16844;182;9;120;343;1.2157

Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money.

Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&#10;&#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&#10;&#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&#10;&#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&#10;&#10;";"Quantum";2013;4;2;60;60;60;13;"['Dice', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Square Grid']";"['Eric Zimmerman']";"['Georges Bouchelaghem', 'Kieran Yanner']";"['Funforge', 'Asterion Press', 'Gen-X Games', 'Passport Game Studios']";7059;7.25835;7989;174;667;2882;273;2.4432

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.)

Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.  A few general categories of rule-sets include:  Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Japanese, Taiwanese, Western, and American.&#10;&#10;";"Mahjong";1850;4;3;120;120;120;8;"['Abstract Strategy']";"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['Barbro Hennius']";"['(Public Domain)', '(Unknown)', 'A.

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.&#10;&#10;Ways to Play:&#10;The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.

These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.

0;189932;"Tyrants of the Underdark is a territory control game with a deck-building element.&#10;&#10;Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";"Tyrants of the Underdark";2016;4;2;60;60;60;14;"['Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Connections', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Variable Set-up', 'Zone of Control']";"['Peter Lee', 'Rodney Thompson', 'Andrew Veen']";"['Rob Alexander', 'Alex Aparin', 'Daren Bader', 'John-Paul Balmet', 'Eric Belisle', 'Sam Burley', 'Milivoj Ceran', 'Conceptopolis', 'Katie Dillon', 'Julie Dillon', 'Olga Drebas', 'Jesper Ejsing', 'Steve Ellis (I)', 'Wayne England', 'Jason Engle', 'Emily Fiegenschuh', 'Lars Grant-West', 'Brian Hagan', 'Todd Harris', 'Ilich Henriquez', 'Rick Hershey', 'Ralph Horsley', 'Tyler Jacobson', 'Tomasz Jedruszek', 'Jason Juta', 'McLean Kendree', 'Vance Kovacs', 'Guido Kuip', 'Howard Lyon', 'Damien Mammoliti', 'Sławomir Maniak', 'Jacob Masbruch', 'Marcel Mercado', 'Marco Nelor', 'Jim Nelson', ""William O'Connor"", 'Héctor Ortiz', 'Ryan Pancoast', 'Adam Paquette', 'Klaus Pillon', 'Claudio Pozas', 'Aaron J.

After shuffling the deck of cards, draw and reveal the first card. Each player takes a number tile matching the card and places it on the table.

0;146278;"Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends is a game played by masters of magic. Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&#10;&#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.&#10;&#10;The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.&#10;&#10;";"Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends";2013;4;2;60;30;60;13;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Catch the Leader', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Pattern Building', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Vlaada Chvátil']";"['David Cochard']";"['Czech Games Edition', 'Cranio Creations', 'GaGa Games', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Hobby Japan', 'IELLO', 'One Moment Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'REXhry', 'Z-Man Games', 'Zacatrus']";6664;7.16695;8530;331;256;1706;292;2.839
0;166669;"San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion.

0;271320;"The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.&#10;    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.&#10;    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.&#10;    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.

He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah.&#10;&#10;A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit.&#10;&#10;A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah).&#10;&#10;If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again.&#10;&#10;If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary.

0;109276;"&quot;Kanban&quot; &mdash; or &#231;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#157;&#191;, the Japanese word for billboard &mdash; is a term for the visual cues that might be used in a lean, efficient assembly line in order to expedite and smooth workflow. These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.&#10;&#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&#10;    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&#10;    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&#10;    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&#10;    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.&#10;&#10;";"Kanban: Driver's Edition";2014;4;2;120;90;120;12;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing']";"['Action Points', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Worker Placement']";"['Vital Lacerda']";"['Naomi Robinson', 'William Bricker', 'Vital Lacerda']";"['Stronghold Games', 'Giochix.it', 'Maldito Games', 'Schwerkraft-Verlag', 'Sherlock S.A.']";6389;7.81538;8506;252;468;2037;523;4.3614

By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.&#10;&#10;Slides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.&#10;&#10;Game moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.&#10;&#10;A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;";"Sorry!";1929;4;2;30;30;30;6;"[""Children's Game""]";"['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That']";"['Paul T.

0;161614;"Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.&#10;&#10;In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty?

Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.&#10;&#10;The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.&#10;&#10;The game features a fun and original movement mechanism.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary &#10;Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards.&#10;&#10;On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes). Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --&gt; out of the race!).&#10;&#10;The first player to cross the finish line wins!&#10;&#10;";"Snow Tails";2008;5;2;60;45;60;10;"['Animals', 'Racing', 'Sports']";"['Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Race']";"['Gordon Lamont', 'Fraser Lamont']";"['Bertrand Benoit', 'Stéphane Gantiez', 'Gordon Lamont', 'Fraser Lamont', 'Judith Lamont', 'Beth Sobel']";"['Fragor Games', 'Asmodee', 'Renegade Game Studios']";6256;6.96823;6591;216;390;1637;389;2.0437

The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets.  They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.&#10;&#10;In this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!&#10;&#10;Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features:&#10;- new wooden bits&#10;- the Swiss Bank &#10;- a new 30 million bond to invest in&#10;- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation&#10;- fewer home provinces&#10;- control of canals (Panama and Suez).&#10;&#10;For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen '09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.&#10;&#10;";"Imperial 2030";2009;6;2;180;120;180;12;"['Economic', 'Nautical', 'Political']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Investment', 'Ownership', 'Rondel', 'Stock Holding']";"['Mac Gerdts']";"['Alexander Jung']";"['PD-Verlag', 'Cranio Creations', 'Egmont Polska', 'The Game Master BV', 'Hobby World', 'Pensamento Coletivo', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";6250;7.66698;7159;143;535;1947;371;3.5094

0;150145;"Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to 'Oh Hell!', 'Wizard', 'Euchre' and 'Spades', with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;";"Skull King";2013;8;2;30;30;30;8;"['Card Game', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']";"['Predictive Bid', 'Trick-taking']";"['Brent Beck', 'Jeffrey Beck']";"['David Bock', 'Eckhard Freytag', 'Apryl Stott']";"[""Grandpa Beck's Games"", 'Devir', ""OPEN'N PLAY"", 'Popcorn Games', 'Schmidt Spiele']";6218;7.4691;12408;135;163;1217;147;1.6871

Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game.

We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government&rsquo;s trusted workers.&#10;&#10;Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock &amp; Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom&aacute;n (El mundo de &Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a strategic, &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.&#10;&#10;When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.&#10;&#10;";"The Red Cathedral";2020;4;1;80;80;80;10;"['Dice', 'Economic']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Rondel', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Victory Points as a Resource']";"['Isra C.', 'Shei S.']";"['Chema Román', 'Pedro Soto']";"['Devir', 'Asmodee Korea', 'Banana Games', 'GaGa Games', 'Hobby Game Mall', 'IELLO', 'KOSMOS', 'Portal Games', 'Reflexshop', 'Sugorokuya']";6174;7.79111;12200;105;444;2572;229;2.8122

0;266083;"In LLAMA, you want to dump cards from your hand as quickly as you can, but you might not be able to play what you want, so do you quit and freeze your hand or draw and hope to keep playing?&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6, with eight copies of each. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white tokens for one black token at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.&#10;&#10;The game ends the round that at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;The original title of this game is a German acronym and stands for Lege alle Minuspunkte ab, that is, &quot;lay down all the minus points&quot;, with &quot;Lama&quot; also being the German name for &quot;llama&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Polish game Lato z Komarami features gameplay nearly identical to LLAMA except that the game has one less &quot;llama&quot; card, and the penalty for llama cards in hand is 10 points per card, instead of being 10 points for one or more llama cards.&#10;&#10;";"L.L.A.M.A.";2019;6;2;20;20;20;8;"['Card Game', 'Number']";"['Hand Management', 'Matching']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Tomasz Samojlik', 'Rey Sommerkamp', 'Barbara Spelger']";"['AMIGO', '999 Games', 'Brädspel.se', 'Brain Games', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Egmont Polska', 'Fractal Juegos', 'Gigamic', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Kikigagne?', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Mercurio', 'MINDOK', 'PaperGames (III)', 'Piatnik', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'VR Distribution']";6114;6.49201;10086;114;68;562;172;1.0581

You've heard of far-off places - exotic countries, where they have pancakes but not waffles, where the people wear the wrong number of shirts, and don't even have a word for the look two people give each other when they each hope that the other will do something that they both want done but which neither of them wants to do.

0;229220;"Santa Maria is a streamlined, medium complexity Eurogame in which each player establishes and develops a colony. The game features elements of dice drafting and strategic engine building. The game is low on luck and has no direct destructive player conflict; all components are language independent.&#10;&#10;In the game, you expand your colony by placing polyominoes with buildings on your colony board. Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony. The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space. It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks. When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points). The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins.

The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action. You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board. The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board. You can't branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color.&#10;&#10;After placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you've touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space. To build, the space must have colored ships around it that match the ships depicted on one of the available building tiles. If you build a personal building that's connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings.&#10;&#10;You can bank one ship before the end of your turn, then you can use any three resources or a pair of matching resources to purchase a specialist, each of whom has a unique power.&#10;&#10;After all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn.

0;34585;"Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game.&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above.

0;265188;"Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.&#10;&#10;In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Glen More II: Chronicles";2019;4;2;120;90;120;12;"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Farming', 'Territory Building']";"['Commodity Speculation', 'Grid Movement', 'Market', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement', 'Time Track']";"['Matthias Cramer']";"['Jason Coates', 'Hendrik Noack']";"['Funtails', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Delirium Games', 'Engames', 'GateOnGames', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lavka Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Super Meeple']";6036;7.97011;10715;80;641;3055;226;3.0354

The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!&#10;&#10;Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.&#10;&#10;";"Stuffed Fables";2018;4;2;90;60;90;7;"['Adventure', 'Animals']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Role Playing', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Jerry Hawthorne']";"['Kristen Pauline', 'Tregis']";"['Plaid Hat Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Italia', 'CrowD Games', 'Cube Factory of Ideas', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'MINDOK', 'Playfun Games', 'Purple Meeple Games', 'Summon Games', 'Z-Man Games']";5955;7.50431;16227;242;499;4168;141;2.4326

0;125403;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Times have been hard. To save on money, you've moved out of your old castle and into a luxurious ravine. You didn't like that castle anyway; it was always getting looted and never at a reasonable hour. And if it wasn't barbarians it was the plague, or sometimes both would come at once, and there wouldn't be enough chairs. The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards. The central themes are the trash and upgrading. There are cards that do something when trashed, cards that care about the trash, cards that upgrade themselves, and ways to upgrade other cards.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;";"Dominion: Dark Ages";2012;4;2;30;30;30;13;"['Card Game', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Medieval']";"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']";"['Donald X.

King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin's magic.

Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards.

0;559;"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Metro";1997;6;2;30;30;30;8;"['Trains']";"['Network and Route Building', 'Tile Placement']";"['Dirk Henn']";"['Barbara Henn', 'Franz Vohwinkel']";"['Queen Games', 'Brädspel.se', 'Calamity Games', 'Corfix', 'db-Spiele', 'G3', 'Überplay']";5926;6.37461;7626;303;112;504;565;1.6885

He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up.

0;47185;"Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws.

However, under the command of Admiral Cain there is no place for compassion or mercy. Now brutal necessity and hard choices erode humanity's moral compass. The Cylons, in turn, are changing as well. The more they are exposed to humans, the more their individual agendas begin to guide their actions. In a time of suspicion and desperate need, the line between right and wrong grows less and less distinct.&#10;&#10;The Pegasus Expansion for Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game brings players the next chapter in the popular Syfy series.

New characters in the expansion allow players to play as Cylon Leaders, who can win or lose based on their own mysterious motivations. New gameboards allow characters to explore both the Pegasus and New Caprica.

Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.&#10;&#10;In The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.&#10;&#10;Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.&#10;&#10;As more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.&#10;&#10;The Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process.

0;9446;"Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:&#10;&#10;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.

0;318084;"Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production. During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up. Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present. Thus, you'll place discs on four cards.&#10;&#10;Once all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right. Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice. Each company card has one action &mdash; either production or processing &mdash; on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side. During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Furnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game. For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a &quot;production chain&quot;, with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;";"Furnace";2020;4;2;60;30;60;12;"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Post-Napoleonic']";"['Auction Compensation', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Auction: Fixed Placement', 'Constrained Bidding', 'Multiple-Lot Auction', 'Open Drafting', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Ivan Lashin']";"['Sergey Dulin', 'Marta Ivanova', 'Ilya Konovalov', 'Vadim Poluboyarov', 'Oleg Yurkov', 'Egor Zharkov']";"['Hobby World', 'Arcane Wonders', 'Board Game Rookie', 'La Boîte de Jeu', 'CMON Global Limited', 'dV Giochi', 'Jelly Jelly Games', 'Jing Studio', 'Jumping Turtle Games', 'Kobold Spieleverlag', 'Maldito Games', 'MeepleBR', 'Midnight Jungle', 'Vagabund']";5661;7.48417;9475;116;545;3354;128;2.2266

When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&#10;&#10;But the time of peace was short-lived.

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes.

The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations.

0;1;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau.

Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.&#10;&#10;In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders.

Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.&#10;&#10;";"Nusfjord";2017;5;1;100;20;100;12;"['Economic']";"['Worker Placement']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Patrick Soeder']";"['Lookout Games', 'CrowD Games', 'Hobby Japan', 'Ludofy Creative', 'Mayfair Games', 'SD Games']";5444;7.64797;8305;82;720;3027;183;2.8634

New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;";"Black Orchestra";2016;5;1;90;90;90;14;"['Spies/Secret Agents', 'World War II']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Hand Management', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Philip duBarry']";"['Dann May', 'Lucas Soriano']";"['Game Salute', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Ludonova', 'REXhry', 'Starling Games (II)']";5408;7.51726;9134;144;496;2784;149;2.4027

0;1382;"A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A re-issue by Alea of Knizia's Turf Horse Racing published by Gibsons Games. This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.

The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).&#10;&#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't.

0;154246;"Ready to start exploring a previously uncharted island? Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&#10;&#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;";"La Isla";2014;4;2;60;30;60;10;"['Animals']";"['Action Queue', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Stefan Feld']";"['Alexander Jung']";"['alea', 'Ravensburger']";5311;6.87098;8329;413;116;611;262;2.2519
0;58421;"The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

Superiority in one of these categories will cause population to shift from other nearby cities when the Voice of the People is decided at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of six turns, the player with the most victory points, which are determined from well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and overall size of population, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: The correct pronunciation is like &quot;Cheetah&quot;, but with the accent on the last syllable: &quot;La Chee-TAH&quot;.&#10;&#10;";"La Città";2000;5;2;120;120;120;12;"['City Building', 'Civilization', 'Renaissance', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Tile Placement']";"['Gerd Fenchel']";"['Claus Stephan']";"['KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'ABACUSSPIELE', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Tilsit']";5178;7.02428;6680;431;202;733;551;3.274

0;421;"1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&#10;&#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.&#10;&#10;";"1830: Railways & Robber Barons";1986;7;2;360;180;360;14;"['Economic', 'Trains', 'Transportation']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Investment', 'Market', 'Network and Route Building', 'Ownership', 'Single Loser Game', 'Stock Holding', 'Tile Placement', 'Victory Points as a Resource']";"['Francis Tresham']";"['Mike Atkinson', 'Jared Blando', 'Charles Kibler', 'James Talbot', 'Mark Zug']";"['The Avalon Hill Game Co', 'Lookout Games', '999 Games', 'Game Harbor', 'Mayfair Games', 'Stratelibri']";5159;7.86538;7967;161;407;1546;553;4.1609

0;25021;"The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).&#10;&#10;The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.&#10;&#10;To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:&#10;&#10;        No dice are used&#10;        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.&#10;        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.&#10;        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.&#10;&#10;No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.&#10;&#10;Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.&#10;&#10;True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready.

0;163745;"Massive Star Destroyers fly to battle against Rebel corvettes and frigates. Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Maneuver Tool&#10;The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.&#10;&#10;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.&#10;&#10;Command Stack&#10;Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.&#10;&#10;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&#10;&#10;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.&#10;&#10;";"Star Wars: Armada";2015;2;2;120;120;120;14;"['Collectible Components', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']";"['Action Queue', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Template', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['James Kniffen', 'Christian T.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Star Wars: Destiny is a collectible dice and card game of battles between iconic heroes and villains that encompasses characters, locations, and themes from the entire Star Wars saga.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Destiny, two players engage in a fast-paced duel, each striving to eliminate the other's characters first. The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm&eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.&#10;&#10;Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!&#10;&#10;At launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets &mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards &mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Star Wars: Destiny";2016;2;2;30;30;30;10;"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Dice', 'Fighting', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Corey Konieczka', 'Lukas Litzsinger']";"['Lucas Durham', 'Vlad Ricean']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Galakta', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag']";5074;7.48119;8159;248;119;540;84;2.2976

The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun.

Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.&#10;&#10;The core of your turn in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn&rsquo;t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like &ndash; until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything.

0;8125;"Santiago is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better.

Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.&#10;&#10;Combining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.&#10;&#10;Simply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes.

Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &quot;counting offices&quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is built on two core concepts:&#10;&#10;1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.&#10;&#10;2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.&#10;&#10;---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----&#10;&#10;Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world.

0;27364;"The general theme and mechanics of Caylus Magna Carta are similar to the Caylus board game. However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    extend the road by building a new building &#10;    pay 1 to draw a new building card &#10;    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) &#10;    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards &#10;    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or &#10;    pass&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).&#10;&#10;Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.&#10;&#10;From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished. Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";"Caylus Magna Carta";2007;4;2;75;45;75;10;"['Card Game', 'City Building', 'Economic', 'Medieval']";"['Hand Management', 'Worker Placement']";"['William Attia']";"['Arnaud Demaegd']";"['Ystari Games', 'Esdevium', 'HUCH!', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Quined White Goblin Games', 'Rio Grande Games']";4924;6.90376;6619;419;122;533;493;2.8702

Inspired by character-driven fantasy storytelling, Call to Adventure challenges 1-4 players to create the hero with the greatest destiny by acquiring traits, facing challenges, and overcoming adversaries.&#10;&#10;Call to Adventure features a unique &quot;rune rolling&quot; system for resolving challenges, a point-based system that encourages storytelling, and over 150 unique cards. Players begin each game with an origin card that provides their backstory as well as two &quot;starter&quot; abilities. Each round they may either acquire trait cards from the board or face a challenge. Challenges each have two possible paths a player can choose from. For example, players who encounter the Thieves' Guild may choose to train as a spy, or train as a killer. Each challenge has a difficulty that must be overcome by rolling successes on carved runes. The more a player has of the abilities required to overcome the challenge, the more runes they will be able to cast.&#10;&#10;Failed challenges lead players to acquire experience points that may be spent to &quot;push&quot; through tougher challenges. But beware, while some negative experiences will help your hero grow, too many tragedies set them on a dark path.&#10;&#10;As players' heroes grow in ability and experience, they move on to harder challenges, eventually facing deadly adversaries and acquiring more and more destiny points.

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar.

With over 120 works of art, 40 scenarios cards, and more than 100 unique trait cards, Oceans is the most ambitious project North Star Games has ever tackled.&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;Oceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean&rsquo;s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth&rsquo;s deepest unexplored region. Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.&#10;&#10;The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface.&#10;&#10;But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper...&#10;&#10;Oceans also includes a deck of 100 unique power cards called The Deep that represents the unknown. These powerful cards break the seams of the reality you've come to accept, ranging from astonishing things found in the ocean, to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Oceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.&#10;&#10;During the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species.  With only 12 Surface traits, it&rsquo;s easy to wade into your first game without being overwhelmed by new cards. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem.  The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.&#10;&#10;During the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability. With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games.  These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.&#10;&#10;The Evolution Series&#10;Oceans is a stand-alone game in the Evolution series, but it's a vast departure from other games in the series. The turn structure has been simplified, the game play is much more forgiving, and the web of interconnections has increased dramatically. Whereas Evolution has the feeling of a traditional back-and-forth battle game like Magic: The Gathering,  Oceans has the feel of an interactive engine builder where everything is interconnected, and where your engine must continually adapt to a changing environment.&#10;&#10;Join the Oceans Discord community for rule questions, strategy discussions, and to get involved in future playtesting.&#10;&#10;https://discord.gg/GMaDycjKBV&#10;&#10;";"Oceans";2020;4;2;90;60;90;12;"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Educational', 'Environmental', 'Prehistoric']";"['Hand Management', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Open Drafting', 'Take That', 'Victory Points as a Resource']";"['Nick Bentley', 'Dominic Crapuchettes', 'Ben Goldman', ""Brian O'Neill""]";"['Guillaume Ducos', 'Catherine Hamilton']";"['NorthStar Game Studio', 'Asmodee Korea', 'Ediciones MasQueOca', 'Funforge', 'Gameland 游戏大陆', 'Grok Games', 'Pendragon Game Studio', 'Popcorn Games', 'Reflexshop', 'Rightgames RBG SIA', 'Schwerkraft-Verlag', 'TWOPLUS Games']";4878;7.54995;9613;186;326;2835;162;2.8272

0;216734;"Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities.&#10;&#10;It's a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all). Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).&#10;&#10;&#10;Let's take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.&#10;&#10;The game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes. Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).&#10;&#10;Player One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first. The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point). &#10;&#10;    Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve.&#10;&#10;The next phase is called Main Phase (1). This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).&#10;&#10;Then they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.&#10;&#10;Then the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.&#10;&#10;The Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.&#10;&#10;The Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.&#10;&#10;The game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.&#10;&#10;DiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle.

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.'

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;";"Paths of Glory";1999;2;2;480;480;480;14;"['Wargame', 'World War I']";"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement']";"['Ted Raicer']";"['Charles Kibler', 'Terry Leeds', 'Rodger B.

0;70512;"&quot;The end of her regency is nigh. It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;LUNA&quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.&#10;&#10;The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.&#10;&#10;LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player.

In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.&#10;&#10;In this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.&#10;&#10;Meadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...&#10;&#10;";"Meadow";2021;4;1;90;60;90;10;"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Environmental', 'Exploration']";"['Action Retrieval', 'Hand Management', 'Layering', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']";"['Klemens Kalicki']";"['Karolina Kijak', 'Katarzyna Fiebiger']";"['Rebel Studio', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Arclight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Korea', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Hobby Game Mall', 'Hobby World', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.']";4769;7.81644;8996;54;563;3298;177;2.2373

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.&#10;&#10;";"The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac";2009;6;2;45;45;45;10;"['Adventure', 'Ancient', 'Exploration', 'Miniatures']";"['Action Points', 'Bias', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Memory', 'Push Your Luck', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Guillaume Blossier', 'Frédéric Henry']";"['Guillaume Blossier', 'Miguel Coimbra', 'Édouard Guiton', 'Frédéric Henry', 'Goulven Quentel']";"['Alderac Entertainment Group', 'Dust Games', 'Axel', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Stratelibri']";4744;6.60642;5607;213;267;1123;369;1.6558

Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus. To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment. Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters. The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.&#10;&#10;Indubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean.

Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed.

Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first will win the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples.

0;62227;"From the box:&#10;&#10;2001: The &ldquo;American Century&rdquo; had closed with a single Cold War superpower standing and a pause in conflict that some at the time dubbed &ldquo;The End of History&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000.&#10;&#10;Bin Ladin&rsquo;s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet &ldquo;Bear Trap&rdquo; of the 1980s. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &mdash; this time within the US Homeland &mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT&rsquo;s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.&#10;&#10;From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and later Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake, Labyrinth combines an emphasis on game play with multifaceted simulation spanning recent history and near future. In the 2-player game, one player takes the role of jihadists seeking to exploit world events and Islamic donations to spread fundamentalist rule over the Muslim world. The other player as the United States must neutralize terrorist cells while encouraging Muslim democratic reform to cut off extremism at its roots. With the game&rsquo;s solitaire system, a single player as the US takes on ascending levels of challenge in defeating al-Qaeda and its allies.&#10;&#10;The jihadists must operate in a hostile environment &mdash; staying below the authorities&rsquo; radar while plotting terrorist attacks and building for the Muslim revolution. Will Iran&rsquo;s Shia mullahs help or hinder the Sunni jihadists? Will the gradual spread of Islamist rule bring final victory &mdash; or will it be a sudden strike at the United States with an Islamic weapon of mass destruction?&#10;&#10;The United States has the full weight of its military force and diplomacy at the ready &mdash; but it can&rsquo;t be everywhere: will technological and material superiority be enough? US forces can invade and topple Islamist regimes, but how will the Muslim &ldquo;street&rdquo; react? And if quagmire results, how will the US find its way out?&#10;&#10;Labyrinth features distinct operational options for each side that capture the asymmetrical nature of the conflict, while the event cards that drive its action pose a maze of political, religious, military, and economic issues. In the parallel wars of bombs and ideas, coordinated international effort is key &mdash; but terrorist opportunities to disrupt Western unity are many. The Towers have fallen, but the global struggle has only just begun. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s roll!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;";"Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?";2010;2;1;180;180;180;12;"['Arabian', 'Modern Warfare', 'Political', 'Wargame']";"['Action Points', 'Action/Event', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Command Cards', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Stat Check Resolution', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Tug of War', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Volko Ruhnke']";"['Donal Hegarty', 'Rodger B.

The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm.   In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&#10;&#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &quot;token&quot; champions.

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!&#10;&#10;WIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW: In Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.&#10;&#10;Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.&#10;&#10;As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!&#10;&#10;After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.&#10;After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.&#10;&#10;Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.&#10;&#10;If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies.

Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition.

Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player &quot;abluxxes&quot; those opponents &mdash; that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent.

By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.&#10;&#10;From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection.  Each round, the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives, and/or attempt to take over factions.  In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group.  That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants.

Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn.

0;224;"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.&#10;&#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;===========&#10;&#10;Contents of 1993 AH edition:&#10;6 page rules folder&#10;6 page sample game folder&#10;32&quot; x 22&quot; mounted mapboard&#10;6 x 96 army markers (25 I/V, 4 I/IV, 20 II/VI, 30 III/VII, 5 IV/VII,&#10;6 IV/VI, 6 IV/V)&#10;6 x 6 Monuments&#10;6 x 7 Fleets&#10;6 x 1 VP marker&#10;20 Forts/Fortresses&#10;28 Capital/City markers&#10;4 Sumerian Armies&#10;five six sided dice&#10;64 Event cards&#10;48 Empire cards&#10;&#10;Contents of 2001 Hasbro edition&#10;11 page rule book&#10;5 dice - 3 white 2 red&#10;30 capitals/cites&#10;32 forts&#10;36 monuments&#10;Epoch I - 5 of each color&#10;Epoch II - 12 of each color&#10;Epoch III - 20 of each color&#10;Epoch IV - 15 of each color&#10;Epoch V - 18 of each color&#10;Epoch VI - 14 of each color&#10;Epoch VII - 16 of each color&#10;12 coins/fleets&#10;8 pre-eminence markers&#10;42 score charts&#10;49 empire cards - 7 for each epoch&#10;22 greater event cards&#10;49 lesser event cards&#10;&#10;";"History of the World";1991;6;3;270;135;270;12;"['Age of Reason', 'Ancient', 'Civilization', 'Medieval', 'Napoleonic', 'Pike and Shot', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Renaissance', 'Wargame']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management']";"['Gary Dicken', 'Steve Kendall', 'Phil Kendall']";"['(Uncredited)', 'Charles S.

0;553;"In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;";"Chez Geek";1999;5;2;60;60;60;13;"['Card Game']";"['Set Collection', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Jon Darbro']";"['Alain H.

Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (&quot;patching&quot;) their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.&#10;&#10;In the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.&#10;&#10;In production, all players produce smartphones.&#10;&#10;In development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.&#10;&#10;In research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players' ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.&#10;&#10;In the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.&#10;&#10;In the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices.

Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.&#10;&#10;As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.&#10;&#10;When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!&#10;&#10;Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.&#10;&#10;";"Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun";2020;4;1;120;60;120;14;"['Ancient', 'Dice', 'Mythology']";"['Action Drafting', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Daniele Tascini', 'Dávid Turczi']";"['Michał Długaj', 'Jakub Fajtanowski', 'Zbigniew Umgelter', 'Aleksander Zawada']";"['Board&Dice', 'BoardM Factory', 'CMON Global Limited', 'CrowD Games', 'Giant Roc', 'Giochix.it', 'Maldito Games', 'Mosaico Jogos', 'Pixie Games', 'Portal Games', 'Rawstone']";4440;7.80603;8341;123;331;2179;385;4.0935

0;41002;"Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.&#10;&#10;This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:&#10;&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.&#10;&#10;A brief description from the rule book:&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. &#10;To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.&#10;&#10;For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). &#10;The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.&#10;&#10;Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.&#10;&#10;During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).&#10;Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.&#10;&#10;The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.&#10;&#10;Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.&#10;&#10;This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.&#10;Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players.&#10;&#10;Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";"Vasco da Gama";2009;4;2;120;60;120;12;"['Nautical', 'Renaissance']";"['Push Your Luck', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement']";"['Paolo Mori']";"['Mariano Iannelli']";"[""What's Your Game?"", '999 Games', 'hobbity.eu', 'Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG', 'IELLO', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Rio Grande Games']";4425;7.22651;4979;170;186;854;374;3.2326

Start by placing your plastic Gingerbread Man (or other character marker) at the beginning of the track.  Each turn, players draw a simple card and move by matching the color on the card to the next color on the track.  Some cards show a named location on the board; players who draw these cards move forward or backward on the track to the named location.  The game ends when the first player arrives at Candy Castle by reaching or moving beyond the last square on the track.&#10;&#10;In the 2004 version, younger players are not required to remove backward on the track if they draw a named card, and the last square of the track was changed from a Violet Square to a Rainbow Square, resolving a 55-year dispute over whether a player needs to land on the Violet Square or move beyond the Violet Square to win.&#10;&#10;Prior to the 2006 version, three colored spaces on the track (one in Molasses Swamp and two &quot;Cherry Pitfalls&quot;) were marked with a dot.  Players who landed on a dot were &quot;stuck,&quot; and were unable to move from the spot until they drew a card that matched the color of the square they were on.

0;18100;"China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;";"China";2005;5;3;45;45;45;12;"['Ancient', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting']";"['Michael Schacht']";"['Michael Schacht']";"['ABACUSSPIELE', 'Überplay']";4422;6.98602;4486;277;143;576;485;2.2866
0;104347;"Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.&#10;&#10;In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.&#10;&#10;All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)&#10;&#10;If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.&#10;&#10;After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.&#10;&#10;Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.&#10;&#10;";"Santiago de Cuba";2011;4;2;75;40;75;10;"['Economic']";"['Commodity Speculation', 'Dice Rolling', 'Memory', 'Modular Board', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Resource to Move', 'Track Movement', 'Worker Placement']";"['Michael Rieneck']";"['Michael Menzel', 'Hans-Georg Schneider']";"['eggertspiele', 'Eagle-Gryphon Games', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Hobby World', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lacerta', 'Ludonova', 'MYBG Co., Ltd.', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Piatnik']";4424;6.89139;4721;95;170;671;267;2.1573

The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship. Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil. Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name. Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement. To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.&#10;&#10;The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.&#10;&#10;";"Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space";2010;8;2;45;20;45;12;"['Horror', 'Party Game', 'Print & Play', 'Science Fiction']";"['Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Movement', 'Hidden Roles', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Mario Porpora', 'Pietro Righi Riva', 'Luca Francesco Rossi', 'Nicolò Tedeschi']";"['Giulia Ghigini']";"['Cranio Creations', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'HT Publishers', 'Morapiaf', 'Osprey Games', 'Santa Ragione']";4412;6.93198;7791;244;262;1625;106;1.8962

Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don&rsquo;t fool everyone.

The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves.

0;104363;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;";"Rex: Final Days of an Empire";2012;6;3;180;120;180;14;"['Fighting', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Science Fiction']";"['Alliances', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Force Commitment', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Bill Eberle', 'John Goodenough', 'Jack Kittredge', 'Corey Konieczka', 'Peter Olotka', 'Christian T.

0;160010;"Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;";"Conan";2016;5;2;90;90;90;14;"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Novel-based']";"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Player Elimination', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Frédéric Henry', 'Antoine Bauza', 'Pascal Bernard', 'Bruno Cathala', 'Croc', 'Ludovic Maublanc', 'Laurent Pouchain']";"['Georges Clarenko', 'Xavier Collette', 'Viktor Dragosani', 'Xavier Gueniffey Durin', 'Yannick Hennebo', 'Kekai Kotaki', 'Paolo Parente', 'Stéphane Simon', 'Adrian Smith']";"['Monolith']";4313;7.67581;8718;255;250;1633;116;2.7759

Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.&#10;&#10;Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins.

Players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings, while placing a worker on a construction site costs money.

To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 10 ecu and an apprentice. Five workers and five buildings are placed face-up on the table, with the others set aside in separate decks. On a turn, you can take three free actions, then pay 5 ecu for each additional action. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Open a site - Take one of the five buildings, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Recruit a worker - Take one of the five workers, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Assign a worker to a building - Pay the cost of the worker (as he won't work for free!), then place him on a building; when the building's needs are met, you earn the points and coins indicated, then flip the building over.

Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&#10;&#10;Each &quot;day&quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats. At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others. As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&#10;&#10;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops.

0;264241;"The Mandala: the symbol of an ancient and sacred ritual. Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards &mdash; but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their &quot;river&quot; and &quot;cup&quot;. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.&#10;&#10;The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one &quot;field&quot; for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the &quot;Rule of Color&quot;: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.&#10;&#10;A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players &quot;destroy&quot; the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river.

0;95527;"Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers. Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.&#10;&#10;Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.&#10;&#10;Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.&#10;Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.&#10;&#10;The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown.

Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Lost Cities: The Board Game";2008;4;2;60;30;60;8;"['Adventure', 'Exploration']";"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Annette Nora Kara']";"['Rio Grande Games', '999 Games', 'Brädspel.se', 'IELLO', 'KOSMOS', 'Zvezda']";4224;6.79221;6590;205;139;843;193;1.7202

You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...&#10;&#10;Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you &ndash; a resourceful patriarch or matriarch &ndash; will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).&#10;&#10;This card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &quot;contribution to the family&quot; cards.

You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).&#10;&#10;Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.&#10;&#10;These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!&#10;&#10;The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.&#10;&#10;";"Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy";2013;4;1;60;60;60;8;"['Age of Reason', 'Card Game', 'Economic']";"['End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']";"['Michiel Justin Elliott Hendriks']";"['Mateusz Bielski', 'Rafał Szyma', 'Barbara Trela-Szyma']";"['Portal Games', 'Gemenot', 'IELLO', 'Pegasus Spiele']";4213;7.14257;5424;224;183;959;228;2.7061

Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.&#10;&#10;During the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice.

Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers.

Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both?

A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded.

A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&#10;&#10;&bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed.

Characters and their actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.&#10;    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals.&#10;    Set dresser: Build the set.

Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.&#10;&#10;On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow &mdash; but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.&#10;&#10;In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points.

0;240196;"Betrayal Legacy marries the concept of Betrayal at House on the Hill &mdash; exploring a haunted mansion &mdash; with the permanency and multi-game storytelling exhibited by Daviau's Risk Legacy and other legacy games that followed. Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.&#10;&#10;Why would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we'll all exit safely this time...&#10;&#10;As with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games. The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families. This isn't just a bucket; it's my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family's pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop. Yes, it's an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it.&#10;&#10;";"Betrayal Legacy";2018;5;3;90;45;90;12;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Horror', 'Miniatures']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Legacy Game', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Role Playing', 'Storytelling', 'Tile Placement', 'Traitor Game']";"['Rob Daviau', 'Noah Cohen', 'JR Honeycutt', 'Ryan Miller', 'Brian Neff', 'Andrew Veen']";"['Scott Okumura', 'Ben Oliver']";"['Avalon Hill']";4110;7.71361;9552;59;277;2869;73;2.8767

Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&#10;&#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&#10;&#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;";"Ticket to Ride: The Card Game";2008;4;2;30;30;30;8;"['Card Game', 'Trains']";"['Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Set Collection']";"['Alan R.

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.

During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities.

To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner!

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Pok&eacute;mon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.&#10;&#10;Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card from their deck to their hand&#10;     Play Actions:&#10;         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench&#10;         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)&#10;         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))&#10;         Use Abilities&#10;    &#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

0;943;"In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;";"Ligretto";1988;4;2;10;10;10;8;"['Card Game', 'Real-time']";"['Pattern Building']";"['Michael Michaels']";"['Michael Michaels']";"['999 Games', 'ASS Altenburger Spielkarten', 'Desyllas Games', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Playroom Entertainment', 'Rosengarten', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Tactic']";3948;6.18165;7888;146;22;128;291;1.1787
0;130176;"The Hare &amp; the Tortoise, originally published as Royal Turtle, is a card-driven betting game about animal racing loosely based on one of Aesop's Fables.&#10;&#10;At the start of a race, each player secretly bets on up to two of five animals: turtle, rabbit, lamb, wolf and fox. One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).&#10;&#10;Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage. The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played. The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played. &mdash; unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move. The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played. The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played &mdash; but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink. The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played.  The wolf also has 3 cards with a howl, if one of these is played no one but the wolf moves.(The track consists of eleven road cards, two covered with water.)&#10;&#10;After the animals move, players start a new round of card-playing. A round ends when three of the five animals reach the goal, after which each player scores points based on the ranking of the animals and how they bet. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The original title of Royal Turtle is a homage to Reiner Knizia's Royal Turf, another betting game about animals racing (albeit horses in that game).&#10;&#10;";"Tales & Games: The Hare & the Tortoise";2011;5;2;20;15;20;7;"['Animals', 'Card Game', ""Children's Game"", 'Novel-based', 'Racing']";"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management']";"['Gary Kim']";"['Gary Kim', 'Mathieu Leyssenne']";"['Piece Craft', 'Purple Brain Creations', '2 Pionki', 'Albi', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Funbox Editora', 'GoKids 玩樂小子', 'HomoLudicus', 'IELLO', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lex Games', 'Portal Games']";3944;7.08776;6592;98;170;881;137;1.3723

On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.

0;22038;"The Kingdom is in chaos. The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?&#10;&#10;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.&#10;&#10;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.&#10;&#10;The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.&#10;&#10;";"Warrior Knights";2006;6;2;240;120;240;12;"['Fantasy', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Wargame']";"['Area Movement', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Turn Order: Random', 'Voting']";"['Derek Carver', 'Pierre Cléquin', 'Bruno Faidutti', 'Corey Konieczka']";"['John Gravato', 'Tomasz Jedruszek', 'Robert Lazzaretti', 'Francis Tsai']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Devir', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Nexus Editrice', 'Ubik']";3936;6.86391;5715;336;185;1011;528;3.5057

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth.

Depending on the tile this can have various effects:&#10;&#10;Treasure tile - If enough of a players adventurers player are placed on a tile, the player can collect that tile and earn points for it. Additionally he keeps the tile, trying to collect treasure sets consisting of the three different treasure kinds, vase, statue and necklace.&#10;&#10;Horus tile - The player can either gain a key or a Horus Card.

0;119591;"In the card-driven board game Rialto, the goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs), which are awarded for a variety of things. The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:&#10;&#10;1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.&#10;2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.&#10;3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.&#10;&#10;In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.&#10;     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.&#10;     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.&#10;&#10;Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.&#10;&#10;";"Rialto";2013;5;2;45;45;45;10;"['Political', 'Renaissance']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Open Drafting']";"['Stefan Feld']";"['Andreas Resch', 'Hans-Georg Schneider']";"['Pegasus Spiele', 'Ludonova', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Tasty Minstrel Games']";3913;6.90635;4639;191;171;693;263;2.5475

Neutral delegates are added by the global events, representing the wishes and trends of society.&#10;When a player (even the neutral player) has more delegates in a party than any other player, that player takes over the party leader seat for that party, and when a party has more delegates than any other party, it becomes dominant.

Influence is gained from being the chairman of the Committee, being party leader in the dominant party, and for having a non-leader delegate in the dominant party.&#10;In order to pay for all these new bonuses, the Committee is revising the terraform rating, lowering it for all players by 1 step each generation.&#10;&#10;In Turmoil, players can try to force their own agenda, or push it in a more moderate, economic way.

People fear for their existence, while scientists struggle to explain the phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Until they came.&#10;&#10;The creatures of nightmare &mdash; vampires, werewolves, and ghouls &mdash; have begun to appear throughout the world, and they show no sign of hesitation in claiming the dark world as their own!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb&#10;&#10;Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&#10;&#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&#10;&#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&#10;&#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Nightfall: Martial Law&#10;    Nightfall: Blood Country&#10;    Nightfall: The Coldest War&#10;    Nightfall: Dark Rages&#10;    Nightfall: Eastern Skies&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Nightfall";2011;5;2;45;45;45;12;"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror']";"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['David Gregg']";"['Conceptopolis', 'Thomas Deeny', 'Andrew Hepworth', 'Daniel Vendrell Oduber', 'Florian Stitz']";"['Alderac Entertainment Group', 'Galmadrin', 'IELLO', 'Pegasus Spiele']";3896;6.48398;5422;449;58;547;257;2.642

0;111341;"The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.&#10;&#10;In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.&#10;&#10;Here's the flavour text from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...&#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.&#10;&#10;Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.&#10;&#10;Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...&#10;&#10;";"The Great Zimbabwe";2012;5;2;150;90;150;14;"['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Prehistoric', 'Transportation']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Mancala', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Jeroen Doumen', 'Joris Wiersinga']";"['Ynze Moedt']";"['Splotter Spellen']";3893;7.81535;5091;55;573;1682;228;3.6842

Instead of gaining three coins, they place one of these tiles in the next open space on a circular display; the law on this tile remains in effect until the end of the game or until it's covered. (Should a fifth tile be placed, for example, it's placed on top of the first tile played.) At the end of the game, players receive points based on how many tiles they played.&#10;&#10;In the second half of 7 Wonders: Babel, one of five age specific great project cards is randomly revealed at the start of each age, and a number of tokens are placed on it, based on the number of players. This card imposes a tax on players who want to play cards of a certain color. When a player pays this tax, he takes one of the tokens from this law card. At the end of the age, if all of the tokens have been removed, then players receive a bonus (which is depicted on the card) for each token they have; if tokens remain on the card, then each player without a token is penalized.&#10;&#10;Just as the cost of cards increases in each age, the number of resources required to pay the tax also increases.&#10;&#10;";"7 Wonders: Babel";2014;7;2;45;45;45;10;"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Expansion for Base-game']";"['Closed Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Antoine Bauza']";"['Miguel Coimbra']";"['Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Repos Production']";3890;6.9378;13949;187;212;1263;126;2.6429

Players draw from the Adventurer deck that contains cards of 5 different colors all numbered 1-12.  With these cards players form combinations to attempt a Strike (cards in a row of any color), a Stomp (cards of the same number) or a Scream (cards of the same color). To capture, players roll a number of dice equal to the number of cards they have of the particular combination. Each creature has different minimum values of a Strike, Stomp or Scream needed to capture it, and a Victory Point amount.&#10;  &#10;The game includes six, six-sided dice with sides 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 4 to reduce extremely lucky outcomes.  The Dragonwood deck has 42 cards, 5 of which are displayed in the landscape at any time.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&#10;&#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&#10;&#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors.

Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.&#10;&#10;After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score.

After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.&#10;&#10;Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness. Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients. More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards. Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.&#10;&#10;";"Tides of Madness";2016;2;2;20;20;20;10;"['Card Game', 'Horror']";"['Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['Kristian Čurla']";"['Mirko Failoni', 'Mariusz Gandzel', 'Aga Jakimiec', 'Chris Ostrowski', 'Rafał Szyma']";"['Edge Entertainment', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Portal Games']";3775;6.80104;8109;298;64;654;63;1.5238

0;2163;"Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).&#10;&#10;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed.

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;In this two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins.

The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!&#10;&#10;In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.&#10;&#10;Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;";"Shear Panic";2005;4;2;45;45;45;10;"['Animals']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Pattern Building']";"['Gordon Lamont', 'Fraser Lamont']";"['Paolo Chiari', 'Gabriela Silveira']";"['Fragor Games', '999 Games', 'Egmont Polska', 'Mayfair Games', 'Raven Distribution', 'Zoch Verlag']";3756;6.35456;5528;307;85;352;399;2.2231

A blessed investigator gains the Blessed card and adds a white die to the player's dice pool, giving him an extra icon to use to complete his tasks.

If the player rolls any die that matches the result on the black die, he must discard both from his pool immediately.&#10;&#10;Blessings and curses don't keep building up on an investigator.

0;202670;"Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe &mdash; which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.&#10;&#10;As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;";"Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails";2016;5;2;120;60;120;10;"['Trains']";"['Connections', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['Alan R.

0;172047;"In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).&#10;&#10;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.&#10;&#10;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.&#10;&#10;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.&#10;&#10;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.&#10;&#10;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.&#10;&#10;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&#10;&#10;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"The Others";2016;5;2;90;90;90;14;"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Interrupts', 'Modular Board', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Eric M.

0;275467;"Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that it&rsquo;s only visible to other players and not to you.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word. The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players&rsquo; letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.&#10;&#10;The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.&#10;&#10;Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their common success.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Letter Jam";2019;6;2;45;45;45;10;"['Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Party Game', 'Word Game']";"['Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game']";"['Ondra Skoupý']";"['Dávid Jablonovský', 'František Sedláček', 'Lukáš Vodička', 'Michaela Zaoralová']";"['Czech Games Edition', 'Cranio Creations', 'Devir', 'Fantasmagoria', 'GaGa Games', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'HeidelBÄR Games', 'IELLO', 'Lex Games', 'MINDOK', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Sunnygeeks', 'White Goblin Games']";3700;7.24861;6696;116;165;1070;59;1.9831

0;115;"User review:&#10;&#10;The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time).

0;117915;"Japan, 1605 &ndash; Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a. Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo. This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868. Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin...&#10;&#10;";"Yedo";2012;5;2;180;120;180;14;"['Medieval']";"['Action Queue', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Map Deformation', 'Set Collection', 'Worker Placement']";"['Thomas Vande Ginste', 'Wolf Plancke']";"['Franz Vohwinkel']";"['eggertspiele', 'IDW Games', 'IELLO', 'Pandasaurus Games', 'Pegasus Spiele']";3666;7.37002;4470;189;319;1395;239;3.3431

Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.&#10;&#10;In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.&#10;&#10;There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.&#10;&#10;Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)&#10;&#10;The action cards work as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.&#10;    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it.

As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an &ldquo;Enter the Horde!&rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.&#10;&#10;With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they&rsquo;ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There&rsquo;s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.&#10;&#10;";"Zombicide: Green Horde";2018;6;1;60;60;60;14;"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Zombies']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Raphaël Guiton', 'Jean-Baptiste Lullien', 'Nicolas Raoult']";"['Nicolas Fructus', 'Mathieu Harlaut', 'Jérémy Masson', 'Thierry Masson']";"['CMON Global Limited', 'Arclight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Hobby World', 'Portal Games']";3594;7.74038;10053;141;147;1016;75;2.4933

In a show of Roman might, he ordered a wall to be built that would separate the Pict tribes from the rest of England. Grand in its design, the wall stretched 80 Roman miles, from coast to coast. Hadrian's Wall stood in service to the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years before its eventual decline. Today, Hadrian's Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the remains of the forts, towers, and turrets can still be explored.&#10;&#10;In Hadrian's Wall, players take on the role of a Roman General placed in charge of the construction of a milecastle and bordering wall. Over six years (rounds), players will construct their fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians by building services and providing entertainment &mdash; all while defending the honor of the Roman Empire from the warring Picts.

0;232988;"A &quot;dice&quot; version of The Castles of Burgundy. The famous strategy game now in pure dice!&#10;&#10;As influential sovereigns, expand your estates through trade and commerce. Combine the dice to your advantage and find the strategy that will lead you to victory.&#10;&#10;Like the original game, the goal is to get the most points, mostly by filling spaces on your board to complete as many color regions as you can. The game comes with 5 dice: one timer die, 2 number dice and 2 color dice. The game is played using a &quot;roll and write&quot; mechanic, where one player rolls the dice, and from the results, each player individually picks one color die, representing a type of hex, and one number die, and uses their chosen combinations to fill in a hex on their individual player board.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one castle space already filled in; from there, a hex can only be filled on the board if it is adjacent to an already-filled hex. Each type of hex has its own rules for which numbers can be used to fill it. When completing a region of hexes, you score points and get a reward depending on the type of hex, which can be workers or monks that you can use to manipulate the dice, silver coins that you can spend to take extra actions or goods that you can later ship for even more points. In addition, bonus points are awarded to the first and second players to fill in all hexes on their board of each color.&#10;&#10;The timer die sets the pace of the game. When it is rolled, players mark a number of boxes on the time track equal to the number of hourglasses rolled on the timer die (one or two). This progresses the game through three phases of ten time boxes each. When all time boxes are filled, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";"The Castles of Burgundy: The Dice Game";2017;5;1;30;15;30;10;"['City Building', 'Dice', 'Economic', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Paper-and-Pencil']";"['Stefan Feld', 'Christoph Toussaint']";"['Julien Delval', 'Harald Lieske']";"['alea', 'Ravensburger']";3577;6.89917;6826;156;128;708;67;1.8507

0;98229;"Pictomania is a drawing game in which everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, giving a chance for those who excel only at one or the other skill to crush the dreams of other players.&#10;&#10;Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&#10;&#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&#10;&#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L&uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries.

The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.

0;20545;"Here's a game that's enormous fun and will sharpen your wits and hone your imagination. The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.&#10;&#10;Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.&#10;&#10;Each jumbo 1&quot; cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.&#10;&#10;Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.&#10;&#10;Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.&#10;&#10;As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.&#10;&#10;Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.&#10;&#10;";"Rory's Story Cubes";2005;12;1;20;20;20;6;"[""Children's Game"", 'Dice']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Storytelling']";"[""Rory O'Connor""]";"[""Rory O'Connor""]";"['The Creativity Hub', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Boardgame Space', 'Brain Games', 'Gamewright', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Gigamic', 'HUCH!', 'Kadon Enterprises', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'MINDOK', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games', 'Zygomatic']";3543;6.27084;9977;176;27;290;150;1.12

0;129051;"Le Havre: The Inland Port is a two-player game in which both players compete to become the richest harbormaster. How they do so? Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.&#10;&#10;Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value! The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.&#10;&#10;Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay.&#10;&#10;";"Le Havre: The Inland Port";2012;2;2;30;30;30;10;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing']";"['Action Points']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Klemens Franz']";"['Lookout Games', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'uplay.it edizioni', 'Z-Man Games']";3535;6.83053;5494;163;212;694;166;2.506

A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!&#10;&#10;In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum. Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck. If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order.

0;619;"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L.

And since 1995, millions of enthusiastic players all over the world have played Klaus Teuber's Catan - a board game classic.&#10;It's time to bring them all together on the Final Frontier!&#10;&#10;In Star Trek: Catan, players start the game with two small Outposts at the intersection of three planets, with each planet supplying resources based on the result of a dice roll. Players collect and trade these resources &ndash; dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water &ndash; in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.&#10;&#10;On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.&#10;&#10;Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan. Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage. When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use.&#10;&#10;";"Star Trek: Catan";2012;4;3;75;75;75;10;"['Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Negotiation', 'Science Fiction']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Trading']";"['Klaus Teuber']";"['Franz Vohwinkel', 'Imelda Vohwinkel']";"['Catan Studio', 'KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Mayfair Games', 'Stupor Mundi']";3497;7.00635;9041;239;119;743;128;2.3672

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original Funkenschlag, designer Friedemann Friese will take you back in time and let you relive the early beginnings of mankind. True to the name of the German edition (a literal translation of which is &quot;Flying Sparks&quot;), it is time for Funkenschlag: Die ersten Funken, or &quot;The First Sparks&quot;.&#10;&#10;The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age. The order of phases during a game round, the player order, the technology cards: you know all these parts from &ldquo;Funkenschlag&rdquo;. But what is new? What is different?&#10;&#10;The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.&#10;&#10;In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.&#10;&#10;";"Power Grid: The First Sparks";2011;6;2;60;60;60;12;"['Animals', 'Economic', 'Prehistoric']";"['Area Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting']";"['Friedemann Friese']";"['Fréderic Bertrand', 'Lars-Arne ""Maura"" Kalusky', 'Maren Rache']";"['2F-Spiele', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Rio Grande Games']";3490;6.79035;4574;226;136;644;230;2.7043

Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.&#10;&#10;The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &quot;Mother carrying small child&quot;, &quot;This is not your place, sir&quot;, or &quot;Under-the-counter goods&quot;. But they have to watch out for &quot;Closed for stocktaking&quot;, &quot;Delivery error&quot;, and for the black pawns &ndash; the speculators &ndash; standing in the queue.

0;1540;"BattleTech (aka &quot;BT&quot;) is a science-fiction tactical wargame in which players battle one another with various war machines.  The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the Battletech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;For about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.

0;202426;"Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.&#10;&#10;Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is almost all simultaneous play.&#10;&#10;Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.&#10;&#10;";"Sidereal Confluence";2017;9;4;180;120;180;14;"['Economic', 'Negotiation', 'Real-time', 'Science Fiction']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Negotiation', 'Real-Time', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['TauCeti Deichmann']";"['Kwanchai Moriya', 'Jesse Seidule', 'Nakarin Sukontakorn']";"['WizKids (I)', 'Banana Games', 'Frosted Games', 'Intrafin Games', 'Lavka Games', 'Pegasus Spiele']";3469;7.79809;5383;152;485;2629;135;3.5556

During the game you purchase machines to place in your factory. Each machine takes 1 to 3 inputs from reservoirs (yellow, blue, red, and brown) and produces one output (of the same colors, or black end products). You must always connect all reservoirs and machines correctly by using the connectors (the pipelines). At the start this is easy, but becomes more puzzling during the game.&#10;&#10;Players start with one of each color reservoir, and can sometimes acquire additional reservoirs.

An average game lasts about 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;";"Hotel Tycoon";1974;4;2;60;60;60;8;"['Economic']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That']";"['Denys Fisher']";"['Denys Fisher']";"['AS Company', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Broadway Toys LTD', 'Denys Fisher Toys', 'Editions ATLAS', 'Fabbri Editore', 'Flair Games', 'Funskool Games', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Hasbro', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'MB Giochi', 'MB Jeux', 'MB Juegos', 'MB peli', 'MB spel', 'MB Spellen', 'MB Spiele', 'Milton Bradley', 'MindTrap Games, Inc.', 'Nilco S.A.', 'Ooba Games', 'Parker Brothers', 'Tsukuda Hobby']";3404;5.49797;5836;162;31;169;258;1.4109

One of the player&rsquo;s Home (white) dice in the cup is replaced with a Leader (black) die. The rules suggest that when players are familiar with the expansion then they should add Objectives tiles. The tiles are shuffled and six are put into play.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;When a Leader die has been rolled with two phase symbols showing, then if the die&rsquo;s assigned phase is not put into play then the die automatically shifts to the other phase on that face. When the Leader die show a dollar sign on its face then if the die is used for its intended phase then the die goes back into the cup (not into the Citizenry) after use. When a Leader die is used as a Consume action, it always matches the world&rsquo;s color.&#10;&#10;The game adds Entrepreneur (orange) dice. When used as a Consume action, Entrepreneur dice never match the world&rsquo;s color.&#10;&#10;When an Objective tile has been satisfied, the player who met the objective receives the number Talent Counters stated.

0;108906;"Thunder Alley is a stock car racing game for 2&ndash;7 players with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation. Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

0;24827;"In Traders of Carthage, players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from Alexandria to Carthage. Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&#10;&#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&#10;&#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&#10;&#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&#10;&#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&#10;&#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&#10;&#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&#10;&#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&#10;&#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;";"Traders of Osaka";2006;4;2;30;30;30;12;"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'Economic', 'Nautical']";"['Commodity Speculation', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement']";"['Susumu Kawasaki']";"['Peter Gifford', 'Atha Kanaani', 'You Satouchi']";"['Cube Factory of Ideas', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Japon Brand', 'Kawasaki Factory', 'Z-Man Games']";3355;6.82142;4797;245;195;894;260;2.0423

With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!&#10;&#10;Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.&#10;&#10;A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!&#10;&#10;";"In the Hall of the Mountain King";2019;5;2;90;75;90;12;"['Fantasy', 'Territory Building']";"['Grid Coverage', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']";"['Jay Cormier', 'Graeme Jahns']";"['Josh Cappel', 'Kwanchai Moriya']";"['Burnt Island Games', 'Galakta', 'Gen-X Games', 'IELLO', 'リゴレ (rigoler)', 'Skellig Games']";3303;7.69785;5932;108;302;1723;145;2.8069

The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building.

The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes.

In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!

Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area.

With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone. However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there.

Along the way, you gain shares in other railroads and watch your reputation soar with each successful delivery before making a final push to complete long hauls to the boom towns of the West.&#10;&#10;This design is a new twist on pick-up-and-deliver games. As players move their trains west and pick up goods, they can deliver those goods to small towns to gain shares in railroads, or hold on to them for a bigger payout when they reach the west coast. At the same time, they try to optimize their actions (and gain extra ones), lay down new track tiles, block the other players, gather and use valuable whistles for special moves and abilities, and carefully manage their coal resources.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Whistle Stop";2017;5;2;75;75;75;13;"['American West', 'Trains']";"['Action Points', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']";"['Scott Caputo']";"['Jason Boles', 'Stephanie Gustafsson']";"['Bézier Games', 'La Boîte de Jeu', 'PaperGames (III)']";3275;7.0959;5194;189;244;1276;74;2.7838
0;141517;"A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman. In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones. However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.&#10;&#10;Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.&#10;&#10;";"A Study in Emerald";2013;5;2;90;90;90;13;"['Bluffing', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Spies/Secret Agents', 'Zombies']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Team-Based Game']";"['Martin Wallace']";"['Geof Banyard', 'Peter Dennis', 'Anne Stokes']";"['Treefrog Games']";3274;7.19355;3457;62;420;1558;236;3.4492

There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;";"Rat-a-Tat Cat";1995;6;2;10;10;10;6;"['Animals', 'Card Game', ""Children's Game"", 'Memory']";"['Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Take That']";"['Monty Stambler', 'Ann Stambler']";"['Björn Pertoft', 'Roni Shepherd', 'Markus Wagner']";"['Gamewright', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'AMIGO', 'Art Games', 'Copag Cards', 'Educa Korea', 'förlAgo AB', 'FoxMind Israel', 'Gigamic', 'KADABRA', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Top Toys']";3253;6.22249;6893;149;22;207;256;1.1211

The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory.

Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&#10;&#10;Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.&#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&#10;&#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&#10;&#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&#10;&#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&#10;&#10;";"Star Trek: Fleet Captains";2011;4;2;120;90;120;14;"['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']";"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Modular Board', 'Tile Placement']";"['Mike Elliott', 'Bryan Kinsella', 'Ethan Pasternack']";"[]";"['WizKids (I)']";3239;7.49783;5117;156;384;1649;248;3.0565

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;";"Inkognito";1988;5;3;90;90;90;10;"['Deduction', 'Spies/Secret Agents']";"['Point to Point Movement', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Team-Based Game']";"['Leo Colovini', 'Alex Randolph']";"['Peter Gifford']";"['Ares Games', 'Devir', 'IELLO', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'MB Giochi', 'MB Spellen', 'MB spill', 'Milton Bradley', 'Paper Iyagi', 'Piatnik', 'Planplay', 'Red Glove', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Venice Connection', 'Winning Moves Germany']";3210;6.59151;6145;228;118;618;220;2.1545

The player receiving the card either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passes the card to another player, peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;To this, Kakerlakenpoker Royal adds new rules and new nasty &quot;royal&quot; critters to create more options for players during the game.&#10;&#10;";"Cockroach Poker Royal";2012;6;2;25;15;25;8;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game']";"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Single Loser Game']";"['Jacques Zeimet']";"['Rolf Vogt']";"['999 Games', 'Devir', 'Drei Magier Spiele', 'G3', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Gigamic', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lion Rampant Imports', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.']";3165;7.06848;6113;80;133;685;84;1.1071

The positions of the villages are randomized for each player, so every game will provide a unique puzzle.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player flips over two terrain cards. Each player must draw &mdash; on their own map &mdash; a trail between two neighboring spaces of the shown terrains. Gradually, the trails will grow into a network of roads. Players score points by connecting matching harbors, and by connecting sights to harbors. Being the first to connect a pair of harbors provides bonus points.&#10;&#10;To add depth to the game, there are varying distribution of the different terrain cards. Mountain cards are for instance rarer than desert cards, so it would be harder to build a trail through a mountain range or over water than through desert or forest. Players need to take this into account when planning their routes.

Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost.&#10;&#10;Every turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people. So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever.&#10;&#10;This edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game. The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency. Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round. To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded.

To accomplish this, he needed a new administration and brought the aristocrats under his control. This was also a golden time for the workers as their skills were much needed to reform and build the new Russia.&#10;&#10;In Saint Petersburg, players play important roles in building the city of Saint Petersburg. To do this, they will take turns selecting and purchasing cards from the display of available workers, buildings and nobles.

When one of the decks runs out, the players play until the end of that round, then the game is over. Additional victory points are awarded at the end of the game depending on the number of unique nobles that each player has, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Saint Petersburg features an additional optional module, the Market, which adds a new card type, the market cards, and a new game phase for them. These cards bring in new resources and not only allow for new tactical opportunities, as having a majority in a resource provides extra victory points during the market phase scoring, but also allow for a fifth player to join the game.

0;17240;"Lots of people grew up playing roll-and-move games, and That's Life!, a.k.a., Verflixxt!, is a modern roll-and-move design that puts you (a bit) more in control of your fate than those games of old.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the tiles in a continuous path, with the tiles either bearing a clover or being numbered -10 to +8. Place wooden guards on the clover tiles and two of the positive tiles as indicated in the rules. Each player has three tokens (two in a five- or six-player game) that start at the beginning of the path.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the die, then move one of your tokens that many spaces down the path. If your token is the only one on a tile when you leave it, you collect that tile, which shrinks the path on which everyone is moving. If a guard is still on a tile when you leave it, you do not collect the tile. If any player's token is on the same space as a guard, you can move that guard instead of moving one of your own tokens, possibly setting someone else up for misfortune on a future turn and possibly setting yourself up for goods things &mdash; as long as no one else lands on your tile!&#10;&#10;Once your token reaches the final space on the path, that token is retired from play. Once all tokens are retired, players tally their points, with each clover you possess turning a negative tile into a positive one. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Verflixxt! includes a number of variants, including one in which you construct the path by laying out the tiles at random instead of in a particular order. The 2020 version of Verflixxt! uses this variant for its basic set-up, with the addition of a double-sided &quot;give/steal&quot; tile placed after every eighth tile on the path. When you collect tiles in this version of play, you place them in a tower, with your most recently collected tile on top. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;give&quot; tile, you must give your topmost tile to another player, giving a negative token to whoever has the most positive token on top and vice versa; you then flip the &quot;give&quot; tile to its &quot;steal&quot; side. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;steal&quot; tile, you take the topmost tile from whichever player you choose, then place it on top of your stack.&#10;&#10;For an even trickier variant, you can play that the clover tile affects only the tile directly beneath it in your stack, turning a positive negative and a negative positive.

0;116954;"Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present.

Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&#10;&#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&#10;&#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem.

Work together to overcome calamities&#10;3. Get at least one member of your party to Oregon&#10;4. Stop and rest&#10;5. Decide which of your friends will  die of dysentery&#10;6. Write your name on a tombstone&#10;What is your choice?&quot;&#10;&#10;All sorts of gruesome deaths await you and the rest of your wagon party in this official multi-player card game version of the classic computer game. To win you&rsquo;ll need to keep one player alive all the way from Independence, MO to the Willamette Valley. But between rattlesnakes, starvation, dead oxen, broken bones, dysentery, and a host of other calamities the odds are long . . . almost as long as the Oregon Trail itself.&#10;&#10;Players work together to move along the trail, fording rivers and playing Supply Cards to overcome calamities. But be warned&ndash;there will be times when it makes sense to let one of your wagon mates succumb to a calamity rather than expend precious supplies. And every time players go the way of all flesh, you&rsquo;ll flip over the roster card and write their names on tombstones (don&rsquo;t forget to include a quick epitaph). It&rsquo;s a great way to relive your fond memories of one of the world&rsquo;s most beloved computer games, and to kill off your family and friends at the same time.&#10;&#10;";"The Oregon Trail Card Game";2016;6;2;45;30;45;12;"['American West', 'Card Game', 'Educational', 'Video Game Theme']";"['Communication Limits', 'Connections', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Lose a Turn', 'Move Through Deck', 'Player Elimination', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']";"[]";"[]";"['Pressman Toy Corp.']";3124;4.23388;8639;411;14;156;42;1.1905

0;527;"GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: In turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.&#10;&#10;GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF.

0;105037;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river. Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated.

One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.&#10;&#10;Maria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.&#10;&#10;Maria takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power.

Each deck has a different symbol on the back to aid with card sorting between rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of her to create her post piles; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to her post piles to create her blitz pile ; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty her blitz pile. If she has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, she plays it to the center of the table to create a Dutch pile. If she has a 2 of the same color as any 1 on top of a Dutch pile, she can place the 2 on the 1. All cards on a Dutch pile must be played in ascending order and must be the same color. A player can also play from the blitz pile onto a post pile, or from one post pile onto another, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the boys and girls alternate.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, she can reveal cards from the stack in her hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card.

When a player does this, they place one of the smaller gangsters from their hand into their play area. To get higher-valued gangsters faster, the player may use the special abilities of the different families at the cost of placing more gangsters in their play area.

Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.

0;57925;"In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table. To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.&#10;&#10;The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.&#10;&#10;So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.&#10;&#10;These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.&#10;&#10;Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.&#10;&#10;Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.&#10;&#10;In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed.

They also try to outdo one another by building tall, mostly square-based tower homes as status symbols.&#10;&#10;In Firenze, you are master builders working on the families' construction commissions for such towers. Each player competes to earn the most prestige points by completing the commissions from families and the church and by placing their seals on the work they have done. When someone plays their final seal, the other builders get one more turn before the final scoring.&#10;&#10;Colored bricks are the currency of the game, and cards can both help and hinder your progress. On a turn, a player must choose a card from the display, taking the bricks from it and paying a brick to every card skipped. There is an opportunity to exchange three bricks for one on display before the player works in their construction site. Players can have multiple towers under construction at once. However, for every brick they wish to add on a turn, there is an extra cost, and if any towers are not built upon during a turn, then they are torn down as abandoned construction. Players must pay attention to other projects so that commissions they were counting on are not snatched away before they can claim them.&#10;&#10;This game won the second prize at the &quot;Hippodice e.V.

0;24800;"Conflict of Heroes is a fast-paced tactical board game series that follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics, starting with World War II and continuing all the way through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! &ndash; Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.&#10;&#10;Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.&#10;&#10;The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;";"Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear! – Russia 1941-42";2008;4;1;120;120;120;10;"['Wargame', 'World War II']";"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Modular Board', 'Simulation']";"['Uwe Eickert']";"['Steve Paschal']";"['Academy Games, Inc.', 'Phalanx Games Deutschland']";3023;7.4997;3941;218;189;1005;467;3.0
0;3570;"Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;";"Chicken Cha Cha Cha";1997;4;2;20;15;20;4;"['Animals', ""Children's Game"", 'Memory']";"['Memory']";"['Klaus Zoch']";"['Doris Matthäus', 'Klaus Zoch']";"['Zoch Verlag', '999 Games', 'Aires, Fanha e Raposo, Lda', 'Devir', 'Egmont Polska', 'FoxMind Israel', 'Gigamic', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Laser plus', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'Milton Bradley', 'Piatnik', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Simba Toys', 'Stupor Mundi', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Tactic', 'ZickZack Spieleverlag']";3021;6.56587;4412;116;101;447;220;1.1227

0;217780;"Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gentes&quot; is a pleonasm of the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: &quot;gens&quot;). In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Buy new cards from the common display&#10;    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)&#10;    Train/Educate your people&#10;    Build/found cities&#10;    Take money&#10;&#10;&#10;To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.&#10;&#10;Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols.

The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.&#10;&#10;The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.&#10;&#10;Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!&#10;&#10;Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.&#10;&#10;Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.&#10;&#10;";"Keythedral";2002;5;2;90;60;90;8;"['City Building', 'Medieval']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Modular Board', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']";"['Richard Breese']";"['Juliet Breese']";"['Cafe Games', 'Pro Ludo', 'PS-Games', 'R&D Games']";2996;7.04987;3535;144;307;785;389;2.856

Each island generates a specific resource: wood, goats, molasses or swords, and players can acquire gold. Each player starts with two pirate hideouts on different islands, and they can use the resources they acquire to build ships, hideouts or get help from Coco the Parrot.

0;2181;"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other. The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;";"Bridge";1925;4;4;60;60;60;12;"['Card Game']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Predictive Bid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Turn Order: Progressive']";"['Harold Vanderbilt']";"[]";"['(Public Domain)', 'Ariel Productions Ltd', 'ASS Altenburger Spielkarten', 'Atlantic Playing Card Company', 'Chas Goodall & Sons Ltd', 'David Westnedge', 'Excalibur Electronics', 'Hasbro', 'House of Marbles', 'Man-indo', 'Michael Stanfield', 'Peri Spiele', 'Piatnik', 'Playbox', 'Skor-Mor', 'TAG', 'TS Spielkarten', 'W.

There is only one way to survive: find a temporary safety in areas where the zombies aren't yet, and forget about values such as solidarity and humanity. Better them than you!&#10;&#10;Who will be thrown at the zombies for the survival of the rest of the gang? Who will take over the security H.Q.? who will look for some first aid material?

Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, a world based on the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.&#10;&#10;The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.&#10;&#10;A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.&#10;&#10;One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game&reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style.&#10;&#10;This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes.&#10;&#10;FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die.&quot;&#10;&#10;";"Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game";2008;2;2;30;30;30;13;"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Novel-based']";"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']";"['Nate French', 'Eric M.

To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king's pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;El Grande Big Box, the 20th anniversary edition of El Grande, includes all previously published expansions: Grand Inquisitor &amp; Colonies, Grandissimo, King &amp; Intrigant, King &amp; Intrigant: Players' Edition and King &amp; Intrigant: Special Cards as well as something currently known only as the &quot;Anniversary Extension&quot;.&#10;&#10;";"El Grande Big Box";2015;5;2;90;90;90;12;"['Renaissance']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Wolfgang Kramer', 'Richard Ulrich']";"['Doris Matthäus']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Z-Man Games']";2954;8.23554;6893;85;393;1349;98;2.7959

0;128;"It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;";"Take it Easy!";1983;8;1;20;20;20;10;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Puzzle']";"['Bingo', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']";"['Peter Burley']";"['Alexander Strohmaier', 'Steve Tolley', 'Franz Vohwinkel', 'Thomas Weiss']";"['Burley Games', 'F.X.

0;218530;"The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&rsquo;ve seen your friends&rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.&#10;&#10;Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.&#10;&#10;Since nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.&#10;&#10;Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.&#10;&#10;For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour.

Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";"Empire Builder";1982;6;2;180;180;180;12;"['Economic', 'Trains', 'Transportation']";"['Connections', 'Crayon Rail System', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver']";"['Darwin Bromley', 'Bill Fawcett']";"['Peter Y.

0;129090;"Roll For It! is a casual, family-friendly dice and card game. Each player starts the game with six dice of a single color, and three target cards are laid face-up on the table.  Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of her dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of her dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with her dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; she claims the card, takes back her dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points. The first player to earn forty or more points wins!&#10;&#10;There are two sets of Roll For It! available -- the red set comes with translucent dice and the purple set comes with pearl dice.  There are no duplicate cards between the sets.

0;43022;"Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).&#10;&#10;Yomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.&#10;&#10;Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Yomi (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Yomi";2011;2;2;30;30;30;10;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Video Game Theme']";"['Hand Management', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['David Sirlin']";"['Concept Art House', 'Genzoman', 'Udon Crew', 'Long Vo']";"['Sirlin Games']";2924;6.95549;3045;162;162;837;195;2.359
0;65901;"Martin Wallace's streamlined redesign of Brass: Lancashire.&#10;&#10;Players are tycoons in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; a time when traditional craftsman were being rapidly replaced with steam-powered machines. Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.&#10;&#10;Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.&#10;&#10;In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.&#10;&#10;According to Wallace, &quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time. The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other.&quot;&#10;&#10;";"Age of Industry";2010;5;2;120;120;120;13;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Transportation']";"['Hand Management', 'Loans', 'Market', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting']";"['Martin Wallace']";"['Peter Dennis']";"['Treefrog Games', 'Hobby Japan', 'Wargames Club Publishing']";2923;7.35903;3373;155;203;808;256;3.3672
0;67492;"Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.&#10;&#10;In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!&#10;&#10;";"Battles of Westeros";2010;2;2;120;60;120;12;"['Fantasy', 'Miniatures', 'Novel-based', 'Wargame']";"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Modular Board', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Robert A.

0;158435;"Dogs of War is an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe. Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor. Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters. Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!&#10;&#10;Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.&#10;&#10;";"Dogs of War";2014;5;3;75;75;75;14;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Fantasy', 'Negotiation', 'Renaissance']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Tug of War', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']";"['Paolo Mori']";"['Mathieu Harlaut', 'Christophe Madura']";"['Asmodee', 'Cool Mini Or Not', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Pendragon Game Studio', 'Spaghetti Western Games']";2896;7.52355;4027;76;310;1086;104;2.6731

In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.&#10;&#10;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves.

Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely).

This is a standalone game set in the same universe as Gloomhaven. The events, however, take place hundreds of years before Gloomhaven and depict the original construction of the city.&#10;&#10;In Founders of Gloomhaven, players use action cards to place resource buildings on the map of the city, use these resources to create more advanced resources, then deliver them to proposed building sites to earn prestige. An individual player, however, cannot do everything on their own because they can import only a small number of resource types, depending on their race. To create more advanced resources, they have to work with other players.&#10;&#10;The game also features an auction mechanism in which players vote periodically to determine which new building proposals come out and where they are placed on the board.

0;111799;"In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&#10;&#10;Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency&#10;&#10;Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&#10;&#10;COIN Series, Volume II&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&#10;&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&#10;&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&#10;&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&#10;&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&#10;&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&#10;&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&#10;&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?&#10;&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&#10;&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&#10;&hellip; and much more.&#10;&#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&#10;&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&#10;&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &#10;&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &#10;&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.&#10;&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&#10;&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&#10;&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series).

0;227456;"Escape the Dark Castle is a simple, cooperative game of retro-atmospheric adventure.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of prisoners, wrongfully incarcerated in the depths of The Dark Castle. Whether it&rsquo;s the Abbot, the Tailor or any of the six playable characters, each prisoner is represented by a character card and a custom character die showing that prisoner&rsquo;s unique endowment of Might, Cunning and Wisdom &ndash; the game&rsquo;s three traits.&#10;&#10;Embarking on a desperate quest to escape, the players must work together using custom dice and item cards to overcome the castle&rsquo;s many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, illustrated chapter card. At the beginning of each game, 15 of these chapter cards are drawn at random from a larger deck to create a unique castle every time.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves one player revealing a new chapter card each turn, in a motion like turning a page of a book. When a card is turned, the next chamber or passageway into which the prisoners have stumbled is revealed. There is no turn order. Instead, players decide as a group who will turn the next chapter card, and there are often grisly consequences for the one that does!&#10;&#10;Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it. In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed. Bribe the drunken guards or attack them? Charge the beast or lure it out? Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?&#10;&#10;Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete it, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group.&#10; &#10;When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy. They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage. Blocking, Resting, and the use of Weapons, Relics and Potions will help to keep the prisoners alive.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is for the group to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, they must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;";"Escape the Dark Castle";2017;4;1;45;20;45;14;"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Push Your Luck', 'Role Playing', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling']";"['Alex Crispin', 'Thomas Pike', 'James Shelton']";"['Alex Crispin']";"['Themeborne Ltd.', 'Exod games', 'Ghenos Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'YingDi (旅法师营地)']";2863;7.47246;4828;40;188;1277;98;1.2143

Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card.

The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness...&#10;&#10;For years, your journeys have taken you across the fantasy realm of Terrinoth, venturing into dark forests, shadowy cities, ancient crypts, and misty swamps &mdash; but your true legend is about to begin.&#10;&#10;Forge your own legend together with friends as you adventure across the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth in the co-operative dungeon-crawling board game Descent: Legends of the Dark. Powered by an integrated free companion app, Descent: Legends of the Dark puts you in the role of a budding hero with their own playstyle and abilities. Together with your unlikely companions, you'll begin an unexpected adventure &mdash; an adventure told across the sixteen quests of the &quot;Blood and Flame&quot; campaign. Throughout your campaign, you'll face undead lurking in the mists, demonic barbarians stalking the wilds, and even more terrifying threats. With 46 pieces of 3D terrain and forty hero and monster miniatures to draw you into the game, your greatest adventure is yet before you! Your objectives will change from quest to quest as you follow the overarching story of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Core gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast and intuitive. You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice. Maneuvering gives you movement points, as shown in the upper right corner of the character sheet, and since you always have a maneuver action, you can reposition to put yourself in a more advantageous position for attack. Other than maneuvering, you can use an action to attack an enemy, rolling your attack dice and drawing upon your hero's abilities and weapons to deal maximum damage or inflict harmful conditions on your foes, or you may use the explore action to interact with a piece of 3D terrain or a token by using the app. You can also use your action to perform one of the most crucial actions in Legends of the Dark: the ready action, which lets you flip your hero sheet or one of your cards to its opposite side, unlocking new abilities!&#10;&#10;Your hero sheet isn't the only thing you can ready. Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards! Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card.  Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities.&#10;&#10;The app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios. You'll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more.

Each player's doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag.

0;23094;"Welcome, dear Imperialists. It's the year 2415. The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&#10;&#10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&#10;&#10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!&#10;&#10;";"Planet Steam";2008;5;2;180;90;180;14;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Science Fiction']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Market', 'Trading']";"['Heinz-Georg Thiemann']";"['David Ardila', 'Chris Beck', 'Czarnè', 'Ian McQue', 'Brian Schomburg']";"['LudoArt Verlag', 'Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag']";2816;7.11618;5362;349;160;771;228;3.7588
0;552;"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;";"Bus";1999;5;3;120;120;120;14;"['Transportation']";"['Action Points', 'Action Queue', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Worker Placement']";"['Jeroen Doumen', 'Joris Wiersinga']";"['Herman Haverkort', 'Tamara Jannink', 'Daan van Paridon', 'Thijs van Paridon', 'Joris Wiersinga']";"['Splotter Spellen', 'Capstone Games']";2816;7.56166;4087;42;530;1479;131;3.0534

0;234669;"Gather your band of heroes and journey to Realms of Terrinoth in Legacy of Dragonholt!&#10;&#10;The first game to use the Oracle system, Legacy of Dragonholt captures the spirit of a roleplaying game without needing a game master. This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!&#10;&#10;Prepare for Adventure&#10;Legacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.&#10;&#10;Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you&rsquo;ve seen before.&#10;&#10;Explore The Realm&#10;Once your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you&rsquo;ve already met their cousin, or if they&rsquo;ve heard of the great deeds you&rsquo;ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed. After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east. Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you. You do not have to be a hero. This is your story, and it is yours to define.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Legacy of Dragonholt";2017;6;1;999;60;999;14;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Role Playing', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling']";"['Nikki Valens', 'Daniel Clark (I)', 'Tim Flanders', 'Annie VanderMeer Mitsoda', 'Greg Spyridis']";"['Alex Aparin', 'Jacob Atienza', 'Jared Blando', 'Anna Christenson', 'Amanda Duarte', 'David Griffith', 'Jaime Martinez', 'Sandara Tang']";"['Fantasy Flight Games']";2807;7.25405;6409;214;323;2241;83;1.2289

Designed by Steve Jackson (I) and illustrated by John Kovalic, this one is destined to RULE THE WORLD!

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;";"Super Munchkin";2005;6;3;90;90;90;10;"['Card Game', 'Comic Book / Strip', 'Fighting', 'Humor']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Steve Jackson (I)']";"['Art Baltazar', 'Lar DeSouza', 'Steve Jackson (I)', 'John Kovalic', 'Gabby Ruenes']";"['(Unknown)', 'Black Monk', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Edge Entertainment', 'HaKubia', 'Hobby World', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Raven Distribution', 'Steve Jackson Games', 'Ubik']";2762;5.86524;6512;267;26;170;151;1.8344

0;1260;"Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers.  The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).&#10;&#10;The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.&#10;&#10;The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.&#10;&#10;Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.  The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards.&#10;&#10;";"Rook";1906;6;2;45;45;45;8;"['Card Game']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']";"['George S.

0;216201;"The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high&#226;&#128;&#144;speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&#10;&#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Robo Rally";2016;6;2;120;20;120;12;"['Maze', 'Miniatures', 'Racing', 'Science Fiction']";"['Action Queue', 'Bias', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Programmed Movement', 'Race', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Richard Garfield']";"['Benjamin Raynal']";"['Avalon Hill', 'Hasbro']";2741;7.01947;5553;110;139;921;48;2.3333

0;198830;"Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea is a 4X-style board game with miniatures that tells the epic tale of orcs vs. humans, dwarves vs. elves, battling kingdoms, and the individuals who turn the tides of war.&#10;&#10;Players control one of these classic factions, competing to expand their kingdom into new territory. Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior. From there, players must explore the territory around them, build up their work force, fortify their army, and develop their kingdom &mdash; all through careful action selection, exploitation, war, and resource management.&#10;&#10;As players reach milestones in the development of their kingdom, they gain access to many advantages. Peons become warriors, warriors become powerful heroes, and town halls eventually become castles. Players gain access to water, and even air, vessels and creatures. Boarding these vessels and creatures with your units allows for faster travel across the vast game board and for positioning armies for powerful attacks.&#10;&#10;War in Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea features a cost/reward system carefully detailed on tactics cards from which players must secretly choose. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units participating in the war. It is here that players wage their wits and legacy in an attempt to exterminate one another. For as we all know, &quot;history is written by the victors&quot;.&#10;&#10;Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea also boasts two economic systems, one being the risky acquisition and careful management of the resources (food, ore and mana), while the other is a twist on worker placement that requires the leveraging of peons to construct buildings, peons that could otherwise be exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating! Finding this balance is crucial to victory!&#10;&#10;";"Heroes of Land, Air & Sea";2018;4;1;180;120;180;14;"['Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']";"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Follow', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']";"['Scott Almes']";"['Chad Hoverter', 'Adam P.

Your people can develop new things like basketry or find oxen or simply GROW and conquer.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Tribes, players control a tribal faction in prehistoric times looking to GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and LEAD their people. The board is modular, composed of hexes in various terrain types. Each hex has a population limit. Players manage the number of tribe members they place on any one hex to either trigger or avoid conflict.&#10;&#10;Each turn the active player rolls two dice, then selects two of the four actions to take -  GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and/or LEAD. Each action is resolved one action at a time. The power of each action taken depends on the die roll plus the last couple of dice placed onto the action board on the selected action by other players. Once both actions are taken, the active player resolves any Conflicts. The final step of each turn is the time to build villages and complete goal cards.&#10;&#10;Victory is possible in a couple ways: gathering resources to build villages and/or completing development and achievement goal cards for your civilization. Villages (limited to 1 per hex) score 1 point for the tribe that built them at the start of that tribe's turn. Goal cards will score points immediately when completed. Every tribe's ambition is to score 15 points. The tribe to score 15 points first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Solo mode, with the addition of Rise of Tribes: The Vul'Keth Invasion (required and sold separately), is a very challenging way to play Rise of Tribes.&#10;&#10;Rise of Tribes - Microbadges&#10;&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10;&#10;";"Rise of Tribes";2018;4;2;60;30;60;10;"['Civilization', 'Dice', 'Prehistoric']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Brad Brooks']";"['Sergio Chaves']";"['Breaking Games', 'Gigamic', 'Magellan']";2738;7.17811;5619;214;134;1016;105;2.1619

Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction. These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed!

With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;";"Merchant of Venus";1988;6;1;180;180;180;12;"['Economic', 'Exploration', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Transportation']";"['Commodity Speculation', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Points', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Trading', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Richard Hamblen']";"['Charles Kibler', 'George I.

0;132018;"The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each other over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated. The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.&#10;&#10;Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.&#10;&#10;The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).&#10;&#10;The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.&#10;&#10;Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.&#10;&#10;As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

0;85897;"Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire!

Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home.

0;2507;"Libert&eacute; covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte&rsquo;s coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1799. &#10; The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!&#10;&#10;It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.

Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!&#10;&#10;Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.&#10;&#10;The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)&#10;&#10;The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.&#10;&#10;Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.&#10;&#10;You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.&#10;&#10;After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.&#10;&#10;";"Corinth";2019;4;2;30;20;30;8;"['Dice']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil']";"['Sébastien Pauchon']";"['Julio Cesar', 'Cyrille Daujean']";"['Days of Wonder', 'Happy Baobab']";2676;6.74841;4738;96;76;508;45;1.7111

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";"Illuminati";1982;6;2;120;60;120;12;"['Card Game', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Science Fiction']";"['Hand Management']";"['Steve Jackson (I)']";"['Jeffrey D.

To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.&#10; On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters!

Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player may:&#10;&#10;     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.&#10;     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).&#10;     Build the Dungeon.&#10;     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.&#10;&#10;Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.&#10;&#10;Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).&#10;&#10;The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.&#10;&#10;This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca.

There's no way to win at the begining, but once a Goal card is played, you have to play the appropriate Keeper cards in front of you or play other cards to keep them away from everyone else, like Steal a Keeper or play a new goal card to replace the old one.&#10;&#10;New to Fluxx are the Surprise cards which can be played at any time to cancel certain plays or steal a keeper as played.&#10;&#10;";"Pirate Fluxx";2011;6;2;40;10;40;8;"['Card Game', 'Pirates']";"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Take That']";"['Andrew Looney']";"['Derek Ring']";"['Looney Labs', 'Pegasus Spiele']";2625;6.18215;6654;143;13;198;122;1.418
0;148943;"In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total.&#10;&#10;A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&#10;    Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game. This is more of a gamer's game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck.&#10;&#10;";"Coup: Rebellion G54";2014;6;3;15;15;15;14;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Party Game', 'Political']";"['Memory', 'Player Elimination', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Rikki Tahta']";"['Luis Francisco', 'Stephanie Gustafsson', 'Jarek Nocoń']";"['Indie Boards & Cards', 'La Mame Games']";2624;6.99722;6670;318;75;533;77;1.9351
0;283863;"The Magnificent is a tightly designed Eurogame from the creators of Santa Maria set in a mystical world beautifully illustrated by French artist Martin Mottet.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are competing to attract the largest audiences to their shows, featuring magnificent performers. In the process, you must expand your camp by placing Tetris-style tiles on your player board, gather elements needed for the shows, and set up performances in your tents.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one die from the supply. The value of the chosen die is your strength. Add to this the value of all dice of the same color that you have already collected, then use this strength to carry out one of three main actions: build, travel or perform. The more strength you have, the better the action will be, but at the end of the round, you must pay &mdash; in coins &mdash; the total of your highest-valued dice color. Thus, taking dice of the same color makes for better actions, but will cost more coins.&#10;&#10;After each player has taken four turns, the round ends. Each player must discard one of their ringmaster cards and score points according to its requirements. After three rounds, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players start the game with four ringmaster cards and a unique trainer tile. Each ringmaster card provides a special ability (which is triggered when you place a die on it) and a unique end-of-round scoring opportunity. When you choose a ringmaster card to discard and score at the end of the round, you must therefore also take into consideration which special abilities you want to keep.&#10;&#10;In addition to your main action, you may use trainers on your personal unique trainer tiles or on common trainer spaces on the game board for various benefits.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, in order of the players' highest-ranked performances, players choose a new ringmaster card and a trainer tile, providing new abilities and scoring opportunities for the next round.&#10;&#10;";"The Magnificent";2019;4;1;90;60;90;14;"['Dice', 'Economic']";"['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Coverage', 'Movement Points', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement', 'Track Movement', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Eilif Svensson', 'Kristian Amundsen Østby']";"['Martin Mottet']";"['Aporta Games', 'Arrakis Games', 'Ghenos Games', 'Hobby World', 'Jumping Turtle Games', 'Matagot', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'YOKA Games']";2625;7.58208;4775;108;196;1142;130;3.1462

0;437;"This earlier Master Labyrinth is very different than the 2007 dragon-themed Master Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, this game is based on the simpler, original Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;";"Master Labyrinth";1991;4;2;30;20;30;10;"[""Children's Game"", 'Fantasy', 'Maze', 'Puzzle']";"['Map Deformation', 'Modular Board', 'Point to Point Movement']";"['Max J.

0;216788;"The first large expansion for A Feast for Odin, The Norwegians includes four new islands (Isle of Man, Isle of Skye, Islay, Outer Hebrides) with Irish coastal viking-settlements on the backside (Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick), where people from Norway came to stay through the winter (longphort), to trade at, and to settle nearby. This offers new strategies and new puzzle-tiles like horse (6VP, 2x5 spaces)/pregnant horse/leather(green)/vadmal(blue) and pigs (1 VP, breed every round; 2x3 - 1 = 5 spaces)/herbal (orange)/ antler (green)/tools (blue). The game has a third box for the tiles and offers the four old islands too (renewed little different VPs and new graphic-aspects of mini-expansion islands Lofoten/Orkneys/Tierra del Fuego).&#10;&#10;The expansion includes another mountain-strip (last round), more two-silver coins, meat/beans and runes/oil and a &quot;little emigration&quot; piece that covers one food instead of two. You get it on a new action-space for giving away a whaling boat. The renewed action board has three pieces that can be turned around for different numbers of players (version for 1-2, 3, and 4 players), which increases the chances of players getting in each others way. It contains new opportunities like butchering, elk-hunting, fishing, and thievery, along with changes for some old actions. It's now easier, for example, to play an animal strategy, also because you can now get two of the same animals in one action. There is also a new fifth column to make a (better) action with your last viking! You can smith, for example, now a grey piece with maximum of eight swords by using an ore and only one action. Also for this, there are five new grey puzzle-pieces like pan, hauberk or anvil and a little board for smithable pieces with fewer than nine swords.&#10;&#10;Totally new is also the idea of a random start-building. Everybody gets one of the six artisan shed boards and can build the front or backside with one wood and one action. These buildings offer, covered like stonehouse and longhouse, some stuff (pieces, weapons, commodities), VPs and one silver (horse stable 2 silver). So everybody has another different start-opportunity - like the profession card. Another new option is, that instead of puting a profession card into the game, you can throw it away for a VP-chip. A nice little competitive element, because there are only two 4-VP-chips, six 3-VP-chips and eight (endless) 2-VP-chips.&#10;&#10;The expansion now includes almanac about game-elements and their viking-history.

Additional information may include special abilities / actions / attacks and potions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on modular dungeon boards. During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to &quot;level up&quot; apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon.

0;340466;"The year is 1913. The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.&#10;&#10;Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.&#10;&#10;If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes.

Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!&#10;&#10;At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together.

Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure.

0;242804;"The low land is a rough area where hard-working folk make a living by the sweat of their brow. Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.&#10;&#10;In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.&#10;&#10;While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.&#10;&#10;On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Lowlands";2018;4;2;100;50;100;12;"['Farming']";"['Action Points', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']";"['Claudia Partenheimer', 'Ralf Partenheimer']";"['Andrea Boekhoff']";"['Feuerland Spiele', 'DiceTree Games', 'Maldito Games', 'Z-Man Games', 'テンデイズゲームズ(TendaysGames)']";2593;7.41248;4350;91;351;1701;75;3.0933

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles.

First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game.&#10;&#10;Second, every route &mdash; whether double or single &mdash; has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll &mdash; which costs 1-4 coins &mdash; to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often.&#10;&#10;These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.&#10;&#10;";"Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 4 – Nederland";2013;5;2;60;30;60;8;"['Expansion for Base-game', 'Trains']";"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['Alan R.

In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&#10;&#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&#10;&#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&#10;&#10;";"Witness";2014;4;4;15;15;15;13;"['Comic Book / Strip', 'Deduction', 'Memory', 'Murder/Mystery']";"['Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Memory', 'Storytelling']";"['Dominique Bodin']";"['Edgar P.

But the fools at the institute, they wouldn't listen. They called you mad! You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you.

(Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&#10;&#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&#10;&#10;There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time.

0;196526;"Coffee Roaster is a solitaire pool-building game. You choose a variety of coffee beans you want to roast, and put a number of tokens specific to that variety into a bag. Each turn, you draw a number of bean tokens randomly from the bag to advance their roast level. When you are finished, you make a cup-testing to check the taste of your coffee and score points accordingly. Each variety has its own target roast level, but approaching the target is not enough for perfect roasting; you also have to even out the roast level of each bean, while not spoiling the flavor of that variety.&#10;&#10;You also have to screen out smoke tokens and burnt bean tokens that hinder your roasting, and reject bean tokens that spoil the taste. It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board.&#10;&#10;There are 22 varieties of beans in the game.

Each tile will have a mixture of any or all of five types of terrain: grasslands, farmlands, mountains, woods, and hills. Each player gets a Player Aid card, selects a color of people tokens and places the era cube of the matching color on The Era Starting Box on the Progress Column part of the game board. A starting player is selected. Some tiles are placed contiguously on the game board (the number of tiles depends on the number of players) one at a time in turn order. Each player, in turn, places three of their people tokens on the game board contiguously. The game is now ready to begin.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;Players should note which terrain will be worth Progress Points at the end of the era. Progress Points are the number of hexes occupied of the scoring terrain by one&rsquo;s token plus the number of city tiles plus the value of all eligible Idea Cards. The player or players with the most Progress Points will advance to the new era and get an advantage over the other players.&#10;&#10;In turn, a player may:&#10;-    Move people&#10;-    Have babies (increase the number of people tokens on the game board)&#10;-    Have a fight (initiate the diceless combat system against another player)&#10;-    Have an idea (draw chance cards)&#10;-    Build a city (replace people tokens with a city tile)&#10;&#10;After all the players have used all of their turns the era has ended.

0;35503;"Ra - The Dice Game takes all the major thematic elements of &quot;Ra&quot; and uses them very creatively in a dice game. Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here.&#10;&#10;Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times. The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.&#10;Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.&#10;&#10;From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &quot;Ra&quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;";"Ra: The Dice Game";2009;4;2;45;45;45;10;"['Ancient', 'Dice']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Franz Vohwinkel']";"['Rio Grande Games', 'ABACUSSPIELE']";2533;6.7827;2280;45;291;715;216;1.7407

You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.&#10;&#10;The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.&#10;&#10;Original description from box.&#10;&#10;";"Pueblo";2002;4;2;60;60;60;10;"['Abstract Strategy']";"['Enclosure', 'Tile Placement']";"['Michael Kiesling', 'Wolfgang Kramer']";"['Jamel Akib', 'Ole Höpfner', 'Joachim Krause', 'Pinball', 'Wolfgang Scheit', 'SillyJellie']";"['Mojito Studios', 'Ravensburger', 'Maldito Games']";2525;6.94453;2553;50;315;911;210;2.2524

0;212445;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.&#10;&#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&#10;&#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&#10;&#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&#10;&#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&#10;&#10;";"Blood Bowl (2016 Edition)";2016;2;2;120;45;120;12;"['Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Sports']";"['Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Movement Points', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['James M.

0;178054;"It is 1882, and the Old Ones are already here.&#10;&#10;They arrived seven hundred years ago and have been ruling the planet ever since. The majority of people just get on with their lives, accepting their monstrous rulers. However, a growing band of revolutionaries wish to free mankind from their slavery. These freedom fighters call themselves the Restorationists. A secret war has already broken out between the Restorationists and the forces loyal to the Old Ones. The invention of dynamite has changed the balance of power, and a lone assassin now has the capacity to destroy an Old One. In this shadow world of assassins, informers, police agents and anarchists, nobody is quite sure who is who and which side they fight for.&#10;&#10;The game A Study in Emerald draws its central plot from the award-winning short story penned by Neil Gaiman, in which the worlds of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft are combined to telling effect. However, to create a world detailed enough for players, much has been added from real history. The nineteenth century was a time of unrest, with many colorful characters fighting both for and against the authorities. A Study in Emerald is the outcome of the merging of these three worlds.&#10;&#10;This second edition of A Study in Emerald sports new artwork by Ian O'Toole and Tatiana Kuzilova along with a streamlined set of rules that will hopefully help those folks who found the first version a tad complicated. Inconsistencies have been removed and the number of available actions has been reduced to the minimum, whilst still retaining the mood of paranoia from the first edition.&#10;&#10;";"A Study in Emerald (Second Edition)";2015;5;2;60;60;60;13;"['Horror', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Spies/Secret Agents', 'Zombies']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Team-Based Game']";"['Martin Wallace']";"[""Ian O'Toole""]";"['Treefrog Games', 'Arclight Games', 'Asterion Press', 'Ediciones MasQueOca', 'Grey Fox Games', 'PHALANX', 'Schwerkraft-Verlag']";2504;6.91077;4365;148;255;1017;126;2.9444

Most locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel &ndash; and time &ndash; to get there with the cargo.

0;66;"The king lies near death, so the princes compete to dominate the kingdom and secure the throne by grabbing as much land as possible.&#10;&#10;This is, in the ideal, a 4 player game. Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from. Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card. The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players. Someone always misses out.&#10;&#10;If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often - not always - but often  choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution. If they cannot come to an agreement they duel.&#10;&#10;This is one of the defining elements of the game, but can take some time (negotiations can) and so was dropped from the re-implementation as Domaine.&#10;&#10;The game board is built of 6 tiles randomly placed in a frame producing a slightly different game each time. It is seen by many as the third in a Teuber thematic trilogy defined by Entdecker, Catan, L&#195;&#182;wenherz.&#10;&#10;The board is conflicted and in the manner of Go the idea is to capture as much territory as possible.  Each player starts with three castles (12 across all four players, and a crowded board). They build walls to create kingdoms, and train knights to defend them, both key actions on that action card they bid on each turn.&#10;&#10;Consequently this is a high conflict area grabbing game with a heavy element of negotiation.&#10;&#10;";"Löwenherz";1997;4;2;90;90;90;12;"['Medieval', 'Political']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Modular Board']";"['Klaus Teuber']";"['Andreas Steiner']";"['Goldsieber Spiele', 'Rio Grande Games']";2495;7.03484;3615;220;84;302;267;2.9288
0;38996;"(from GMT's website:)&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.&#10;&#10;The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition.

0;34194;"In Aquaretto, the players are managing the planning and selection of animals for their water themed zoo, in the hope of acquiring the most victory points. The players can expand the size of their water park and victory points can be earned in a number of ways. The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.&#10;&#10;The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.&#10;&#10;The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.&#10;&#10;Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby. There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.&#10;&#10;Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park.&#10;&#10;";"Aquaretto";2008;5;2;45;45;45;10;"['Animals']";"['Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']";"['Michael Schacht']";"['Design/Main']";"['ABACUSSPIELE', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'Playgo Ltd (Hong Kong)', 'Rio Grande Games']";2487;6.98132;3143;84;160;435;211;2.1137

0;1634;"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    24 plastic shields&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Warhammer Quest";1995;4;1;120;120;120;12;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing']";"['Andy Jones']";"['John Blanche', 'Wayne England', 'David Gallagher', 'Mark Gibbons', 'Geoff Taylor', 'Richard Wright']";"['Games Workshop Ltd.']";2465;7.48417;3246;50;333;941;170;2.6882

So you have five dice for each of the speeds and two of &quot;gas&quot; to continue moving without changing your speed. Each die is playable exactly once each turn.

0;24773;"Aim of the game from the rulebook:&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build the most successful Underground lines and in doing so gain the most points.  You can gain points by connecting your lines to various destinations on the board, and by having the passenger use your lines to travel from station to station.&#10;&#10;The player who has best balanced the demands by the time that the deck of destinations is exhausted will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;&#10;In On the Underground, the players represent companies building underground lines in London. Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color. All track pieces must extend the color. Alternatively, a player may decide to use two branch tokens (acquired by extending lines to the terminus stations or skipping building turns) to branch out of the line.&#10;&#10;During the track building part, the active player can score in four different ways:&#10;&#10;     Connect their line to a station with a National Rail symbol (1p)&#10;     Connect their line to a terminus station (2p + a branch token)&#10;     Connect two connection tokens of the same type (3p)&#10;     Building a circular line (1p for each station &quot;inside&quot; the line)&#10;&#10;&#10;After each turn, the passenger moves to one or two of the four face up destination cards; first to one express destination and then to a regular destination. If there are no cards face up in either type, the passenger only moves once. The passenger always uses the shortest route from their current position, avoiding walking and line changes. The passenger scores one point for each line they used to get to their destination.&#10;&#10;When there is not enough destination cards to turn face up from the deck, the passenger marker is removed from the game. Players get equal turns, but after the passenger marker is removed, no more points are awarded from passenger movement and players can only build track.

0;102237;"Drako: Dragon &amp; Dwarves is an asymmetrical game for two players, with one player leading a team of three dwarves who are experienced dragon hunters and the other playing a red dragon that has spread terror amongst local peasants. The dwarves have managed to trap the dragon in a shady valley at the foot of the mountain where it lives &ndash; apparently dragons can't resist the smell of freshly slaughtered sheep &ndash; but despite being in chains, the dragon is still young and ferocious, providing the dwarves with the difficult task of killing it without being killed themselves.&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The dragon can move around the game board, bite, shoot fire, fly (in a limited way), and defend itself from attacks; the dwarves can attack with their axes, shoot crossbows, move individually or in groups, protect themselves with shields, and cast nets.&#10;&#10;Each player can have up to six cards in hand, and managing these cards and maneuvering their characters on the game board are the keys to victory. Has the opponent run out of defense cards? Can the dragon nip the strongest dwarf and take him out without opening himself up to attacks from the others? The dwarves can attack the dragon's wings to keep it from flying, chop its legs so it can't move, and cut its throat to prevent it from breathing fire.&#10;&#10;If the dwarves kill the dragon before it breaks from the trap &ndash; that is before dwarves run out of cards &ndash; they win.

0;182694;"Watson &amp; Holmes is a game of deduction set within the magnificent works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;";"Watson & Holmes";2015;7;2;75;45;75;12;"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Novel-based']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Jesús Torres Castro']";"['Javier González Cava', 'Arnaud Demaegd', 'Neriac', 'David Prieto', 'Pascal Quidault']";"['Ludonova', 'Asmodee', 'Asterion Press', 'Hobby Japan', 'MYBG Co., Ltd.', 'Space Cowboys', 'Summon Games']";2462;7.31539;5204;172;202;1318;49;2.1633

When a city is completed, all players score points for &quot;guild cards&quot; they play, with the right timing in playing the right card making all the difference.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player first establishes a new wall somewhere on the board. Each wall will be enclosed by two towers, and will have one house placed on each side of it. It's possible for a wall to need only one, or zero, new towers by putting it next to existing towers. It's possible for only one house to be placed, if the wall is placed along the outside of the game board.&#10;After placing the wall, the player rolls three dice to determine the color of one of the towers (the color of a possible second tower may be freely chosen), and that of the two houses (if only one house is placed, then the player may choose which of the dice to pick for the color of the house).&#10;Finally, if the newly placed wall causes a piece of land to be fully enclosed, a new city has been established. If the new city borders one or more existing cities, it may be combined with one of those cities. Two houses of the same color inside the city are upgraded to a palace. A scoring round is now triggered, during which all players get to play one or two &quot;guild cards&quot;, and then draw one new card. Each guild card will score a feature of either the just completed city, or outside it. Possible features are the number of houses &amp; palaces or towers of a specified color, the number of fields of the city, the number of houses inside a &quot;district&quot; on the board, the number of palaces inside a city, the different number of colors inside a city, or the total number of completed cities. At the end of a scoring round, whichever player is in last place may discard as many guild cards as desired, and draw new ones to replace them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all pieces of a certain type have been played, and the winner is whoever has the most points.&#10;&#10;";"Masons";2006;4;2;45;45;45;8;"['City Building', 'Medieval']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management']";"['Leo Colovini']";"['Franz Vohwinkel']";"['999 Games', 'Hans im Glück', 'Rio Grande Games']";2454;6.49521;3014;248;54;244;288;2.1354

Once peaceful and neighborly, the Masters of the competing mountain-folk train their students and send them out across bridges to control neighboring villages. To take control of a village, the students must come together in uncomfortable alliances, regardless of their tribal origin. Eventually students become Masters themselves, train new students and expand to other villages.&#10;&#10;There is one thing each student must keep in mind as they travel from village to village -- the mystical powers of Shangri-La mysteriously cause the bridges to collapse, separating villages forever. One crucial question will decide the winner: who will control the most Masters of Shangri-La?&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders.

0;949;"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;";"Twixt";1962;4;2;30;30;30;12;"['Abstract Strategy']";"['Connections', 'Network and Route Building']";"['Alex Randolph']";"['(Uncredited)']";"['3M', 'Alga', 'The Avalon Hill Game Co', 'Dujardin', 'Felsberger', 'GP Games', 'Klee', 'KOSMOS', ""Lil' Cerebral"", 'Schmidt International', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Selecta Spel en Hobby']";2449;6.58883;5185;350;44;250;192;2.4948

0;252328;"X-Wing Second Edition puts you in command of your own squadron of advanced starfighters locked in thrilling, tactical space combat. Following in the footsteps of the first edition, the second edition refines the intuitive and exciting core formula of maneuvering your ships into position by placing a central focus on the visceral thrill of flying starships in the Star Wars galaxy.&#10;&#10;During a battle, you&rsquo;ll use your squadron&rsquo;s unique capabilities to give yourself an advantage in the thick of combat. Each X-Wing ship flies differently, with its own set of maneuvers ranging from gentle banks to aggressive Koiogran turns. As in the game&rsquo;s first edition, you&rsquo;ll need to use every ship&rsquo;s maneuvering capabilities to the fullest in order to strategically position your ships. A round begins with players secretly selecting a maneuver on each of their ships&rsquo; unique maneuver dials. Once you&rsquo;ve decided how each of your ships is going to fly, you&rsquo;ll begin revealing the dials and moving your ships, starting with the lowest skilled pilots.&#10;&#10;As you move, you&rsquo;ll enter a tense duel with your opponent as you both try to line up the perfect shot. Before you can open fire on an opponent&rsquo;s ship, however, they must be in your firing arc and within range. By carefully selecting your maneuvers, you can get enemy ships in your sights, and once you&rsquo;ve locked onto your target, you&rsquo;re free to choose your plan of attack. You might pepper the enemy with blaster fire to whittle away their shields. Or, you could go for massive damage and launch a devastating volley of proton torpedoes. No matter how you approach the battle, you have complete control of your squadron. One player wins when all of their opponent&rsquo;s ships are destroyed!&#10;&#10;Slick flying is certainly important, but it isn&rsquo;t the only consideration you&rsquo;ll have to make in the midst of a dogfight. As in the first edition of X-Wing, once your ships have completed a maneuver, you can also perform an action to gain the upper hand. Whether you choose to acquire a target lock on a rival ship or barrel roll out of an enemy&rsquo;s firing arc, the actions you take affect the course of the battle and determine the fate of your squadron.&#10;&#10;Now, in the second edition of the game, your actions offer greater strategic depth than ever before. Some actions are red and induce stress when they are used. Other actions may be linked, allowing you to chain two actions together and push the limits of how your ship can handle in a dogfight!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)";2018;2;2;45;30;45;14;"['Aviation / Flight', 'Bluffing', 'Collectible Components', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']";"['Action Queue', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Template', 'Player Elimination', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Jason Little', 'Frank Brooks']";"['Jason Little']";"['Fantasy Flight Games', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee China', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.']";2412;8.15557;5314;47;69;414;50;3.06

If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.&#10;&#10;It's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips.

If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they're worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.&#10;&#10;There's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players.

The twist is that you must move the tower of the color matching the space on which the opponent moved on her previous turn.

If you can't move, your opponent moves again immediately, moving the tower matching the color of the space occupied by the stymied tower.&#10;&#10;As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to &quot;Sumos&quot; and have the ability to push your opponent's pieces backwards, earning you extra turns.

0;3085;"Gang of Four&trade; is an exciting game of Cunning, Strategy and Power. The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Big Two&#10;&#10;";"Gang of Four";1990;4;3;40;40;40;8;"['Card Game', 'Political']";"['Hand Management', 'Ladder Climbing', 'Set Collection', 'Trick-taking']";"['Lee Yih']";"['(Uncredited)', 'Franck Achard', 'Cyrille Daujean']";"['Days of Wonder', 'Edge Entertainment', 'The Game Dealers Ltd.', 'Happy Baobab', 'Jeux Dargaud']";2352;6.62011;4171;163;42;191;207;1.8696

Your mission is clear: Procure valuable bots and plug them into your network. They'll have an effect on your systems. Anticipate it correctly, program your bots effectively, and attract the right investors to win and lead the sentient revolution.&#10;&#10;In Sentient, players are tasked with choosing from available robots to program in their factory. Each robot that is added modifies your board and attracts the interest of investors for your company. Program your bots efficiently and collect the support of your patrons to build the most formidable operation.&#10;&#10;Description from GTS article:&#10;&#10;Sentient is a dice-manipulation game by J. Alex Kevern (World&rsquo;s Fair 1893, Gold West). As with his other games, Sentient is filled with smart, simple, and rewarding choices. Each turn involves choosing an available bot, adding it to your factory, and deciding how to divide your resources between optimizing your bot and wooing investors. Players who enjoy a satisfying puzzle will appreciate the difficulty in adding the chosen bot to their factory. Each slot has a die on either side that will be modified based on the chosen bot card. But, adding another adjacent bot the next turn will modify the dice once again. The dice at the end of the round will determine how efficiently your bots were programmed and will grant you varying points based on the dice numbers. You may have everything perfectly sorted out &mdash; that is, until the last bot you choose changes the adjacent dice. Your plan can crumble and points can easily be lost with an errant decision or wrong choice!&#10;&#10;";"Sentient";2017;4;2;60;45;60;12;"['Industry / Manufacturing', 'Math', 'Science Fiction']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']";"['J.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;";"Munchkin Fu";2003;6;3;90;90;90;10;"['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Humor']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Steve Jackson (I)']";"['Alex Fernandez (I)', 'Greg Hyland', 'John Kovalic', 'Gabby Ruenes']";"['Hobby World', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Raven Distribution', 'Steve Jackson Games']";2342;5.87059;4858;183;31;162;164;1.7378
0;2122;"Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.&#10;&#10;VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.&#10;&#10;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.&#10;&#10;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor!

Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.&#10;&#10;Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.&#10;&#10;Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.&#10;&#10;Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.&#10;&#10;";"Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition)";1998;6;2;120;30;120;17;"['Book', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Line of Sight', 'Measurement Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Andy Chambers', 'Jervis Johnson', 'Rick Priestley', 'Gavin Thorpe']";"['John Blanche']";"['Games Workshop Ltd.']";2339;6.50922;3476;88;44;80;205;3.4976

A set of action cards is available to the players to guide their civilization, and used actions form a discard queue from which they are taken back into a player's hand during the game.

The cradle of modern humans, called Homo sapiens by scientists, was located in Africa more than 100,000 years ago. The first branches of this family began a journey that spanned thousands of years. Eventually leading them to Australia and America. The enormous difficulties of this journey were overcome because of Homo sapiens' unique ability to adapt to its environment. Their highly developed brains and their mastery of crafts enabled them to flourish in even the harshest conditions.&#10;&#10;In this exciting game, you will guide the journey of one of these branches. You must strive to spread your people over the whole world. In order to expand your branch of humanity, you must develop certain talents: advances in the preparation of food will allow your people to spread faster and wider, while new hunting techniques can protect them from dangers. And your people will need warm clothes to cross the ice deserts of the north and boats to settle Australia.&#10;&#10;Of course, all of this is possible only if you have enough raw materials: meat, hides, bones and flint.&#10;&#10;There are many paths that you may follow to victory. But it is certain that the player that settles in the most productive lands, trades for missing raw materials with the other players most skillfully, and is able to best penetrate the lands of Australia and America, will end the game with their nose in front!&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series and is retroactively a member of Catan Histories.&#10;&#10;";"The Settlers of the Stone Age";2002;4;3;120;90;120;10;"['Civilization', 'Exploration', 'Negotiation', 'Prehistoric']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Network and Route Building', 'Trading']";"['Klaus Teuber']";"['Tanja Donner', 'Franz Vohwinkel']";"['KOSMOS', '999 Games', 'Mayfair Games', 'Zvezda']";2334;6.5751;3751;211;57;204;243;2.5144
0;27976;"The second Master Set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles. Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options.

There is no farming equivalent. Faction symbols (Empire, Rebel Alliance and Bounty Hunters) provide scoring bonuses regardless of what faction your Meeples belong to. Majority control is determined by dice rolling with the highest result rather than the sum determining the winner, although tiebreaks and defeats still provide some points. A player receives dice equal to the number of his Meeples involved in the majority control plus an additional one for using his large Meeple and one for any matching Faction symbols but this is always capped at three dice. One notable change is that Planets can be conquered by placing tiles adjacent to the Planet tile where the player now has the options of placing a Meeple on the adjacent Planet tile or on the tile he placed.&#10;&#10;There is also a four player team variant where it is the two Empire colours (black/Darth Vader and white/Storm Troopers) versus the two Rebel Alliance colours (red/Luke Skywalker and green/Yoda).

(Hence the subtitle of the game, &quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built.&quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it's someone else turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk).  So a feature of &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another's turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points.

0;9028;"The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!&#10;&#10;Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.&#10;&#10;This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?&#10;&#10;Description from Uberplay's web site:&#10;&#10;While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.&#10;&#10;";"Tongiaki: Journey into the Unknown";2004;6;2;45;45;45;10;"['Exploration', 'Nautical', 'Transportation']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement']";"['Thomas Rauscher']";"['Claus Stephan']";"['PS-Games', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Überplay']";2310;6.22224;2680;227;38;157;262;1.958

Players &quot;bid&quot; in the auctions by offering up cards representing the skills they will offer to help Beowulf succeed (fighting, cunning, etc.) in an attempt to earn rewards of points or powerful cards, or to avoid injuries or other penalties. Players can also take a `Risk' and draw two cards from the deck to bid with. But if the cards don't match the current auction, the player is forced to drop out.

Sun Tzu and his Wu soldiers were outnumbered and King Shao's armies held the high ground. Sun Tzu feigned retreat and tricked King Shao into spreading out his forces, ready to pursue. With the Ch'u scattered, Sun Tzu crushed their forces in piecemeal fashion at the battle of Bai Ju, routing the Ch'u back to their capital of Ying. King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In Sun Tzu, a.k.a.

Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province. Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card.

0;232;"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;";"Serenissima";1996;4;2;120;120;120;12;"['Economic', 'Nautical', 'Renaissance']";"['Pick-up and Deliver', 'Trading']";"['Dominique Ehrhard', 'Duccio Vitale']";"['Dominique Ehrhard', 'Guillaume Rohmer', 'Duccio Vitale']";"['Descartes Editeur', 'Eurogames', '999 Games']";2270;6.8629;3127;207;63;259;255;3.0392

Nomad tiles allow a player to build three settlements on the specified terrain, move settlements, build without following the adjacency rule, remove another player's settlement, or score points.&#10;&#10;The new scoring cards give points as you place settlements during your turn, specifically for placing settlements in a straight line, for placing settlements next to those of other players, and for placing settlements on terrain that's not adjacent to empty terrain of the same type. (Replacement scoring cards for &quot;Workers&quot; and &quot;Merchants&quot; are included in Kingdom Builder: Nomads and should be used in place of those in the base game. These cards merely reflect the fact that the expansion boards have Nomad spaces which also count for scoring for these cards.)&#10;&#10;In addition to the quarry power &ndash; which both helps block opponents and fill spaces in which you don't want to place settlements &ndash; the new location powers allow you to place a settlement in the flower fields, to place a settlement adjacent to at least three of your own settlements, and to move a settlement in a straight line on the board until it hits an obstacle.&#10;&#10;Kingdom Builder: Nomads FAQ&#10;&#10;";"Kingdom Builder: Nomads";2012;5;2;45;45;45;8;"['Expansion for Base-game', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Enclosure', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building']";"['Donald X.

Lovecraft, 1923&#10;&#10;In the unimaginable darkness of Kingsport, silent wanderers are called to a profane celebration. Their goal: to invoke unthinkable horrors! A dread terror that is not of this world or any other &mdash; but rather from the spaces between the stars &mdash; demands your submission. Meanwhile, unwary investigators vainly attempt to halt this appalling chapter in the dark history of Arkham.&#10;&#10;As the high priest of one of these shadowy cults, you must dominate the city. You will invoke cosmic creatures and unholy gods to receive their &quot;gifts&quot;, but you must take care to preserve your sanity and thwart the investigators who seek to stop you. This time, you are the bad guys. Why settle for the lesser evil?&#10;&#10;Kingsport Festival, a game of bizarre cults set in the terrifying world of Howard Philips Lovecraft, lasts 12 rounds, each divided into six phases. All Cultists roll their dice and the one that rolled the lowest sum will play first and so on, then (in turn order) each one may invoke an Elder God by using one or more of his dice, where the sum of their values is exactly equal to the number of the Elder God, or pass. Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards. After Cultists have taken their dice back, in turn order each one may place his disk on one Building that is connected to another one he has already marked (starting from the House). To do so, he must pay the Domain resources required.&#10;&#10;In turns marked with a blue marker on the Calendar, a Raid takes place: first the Event card and then the Investigator card is revealed. Each Cultist calculates his Strength by adding up any modifiers he has due to Spells, Buildings, and other game effects (such as Events, Scenarios, etc.). If his strength is greater, the Cultist receives rewards; if is less, he suffers the penalty.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the twelfth round is played.

In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.&#10;&#10;Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"City of the Big Shoulders";2019;4;2;180;120;180;14;"['Economic', 'Educational', 'Industry / Manufacturing']";"['Commodity Speculation', 'Ownership', 'Stock Holding', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']";"['Raymond Chandler III']";"['Emily R.

(Each action has a unique effect as well.) When you play a holding with one or more symbols, you place a token on that card for each symbol on it and an additional token for each symbol of that type already in your possession.

0;154825;"In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&#10;&#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&#10;&#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out.

0;8045;"Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.&#10;&#10;";"Princes of the Renaissance";2003;6;3;180;180;180;12;"['Economic', 'Negotiation', 'Renaissance']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Martin Wallace']";"['Michael Christopher', 'Peter Dennis', 'Richard Hanuschek']";"['Mercury Games', 'Warfrog Games', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag']";2254;7.33231;3245;153;252;712;241;3.5104

During Spring, players add 1 or 2 land tiles to their farm. During Summer, players position their workers in their fields to gather resources. When Autumn comes, all players get to visit the city. Finally, during the Winter phase, players need to feed their workers and heat their homes.&#10;&#10;When placing tiles, their sides do not need to match. But you generally want them to, because each land area will produce resources based on its size, when you send a worker there.&#10;&#10;In the city you can hire more workers, sell goods to gain coins, build improvements, and so on. Each player may do only one action in the city each year. The city is a kind of rondel that is divided into halves; each time you cross the midline you have to pay a coin. Therefore it is wise to move as slowly as possible on the rondel, but then again, you have consider what actions you want to take!

0;592;"This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks he'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.&#10;&#10;Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries. To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds. Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand. The player who wins that hand gains point, the loser loses the same amount of points.&#10;&#10;";"Spades";1938;4;4;60;60;60;10;"['Card Game']";"['Auction/Bidding', 'Predictive Bid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']";"['(Uncredited)']";"[]";"['(Public Domain)', 'Fundex']";2249;6.7726;1337;0;5;34;176;2.0227
0;166226;"In The Staufer Dynasty, the players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern-day Germany, from the Baltic Sea in the north to Sicily in the south. You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&#10;&#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&#10;&#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&#10;&#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";"The Staufer Dynasty";2014;5;2;90;90;90;13;"['Medieval']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Set Collection']";"['Andreas Steding']";"['Franz Vohwinkel']";"['Arclight Games', 'Hans im Glück', 'Z-Man Games']";2250;7.15894;3359;163;94;424;117;2.9829

Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud.

0;55697;"This description was originally based on a review from BoardgameNews.com.&#10;&#10;In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points. You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.&#10;&#10;The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.&#10;&#10;After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.&#10;&#10;It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.&#10;&#10;Awards: &#10;Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from &quot;Die Firma&quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game.&#10;&#10;";"Power Struggle";2009;5;3;105;105;105;12;"['Humor', 'Negotiation']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Bribery']";"['Bauldric & Friends']";"['Fréderic Bertrand', 'Lars-Arne ""Maura"" Kalusky']";"['eggertspiele', 'IELLO', 'Z-Man Games']";2242;6.97449;3278;305;61;377;214;3.3505

Akbar has preserved peace and Order throughout his empire by passing laws that have won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects.

0;11634;"Mexican Train is a fairly recently developed variation of Domino train type games that has become extremely popular.  Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.&#10;&#10;Although Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominos, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the &quot;Mexican train&quot;, and a &quot;woo woo!&quot; train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as &quot;Mexican Train Dominoes&quot; that include all the necessary components to play.&#10;&#10;A double-twelve domino set has 91 tiles. The goal is for the players to get rid of their dominoes. Starting with the highest double tile placed in the middle of the table, which is the station, each player creates a line of dominoes. This is their train. Another train, the &quot;Mexican Train,&quot; can be played on by anyone. In the event that a player cannot play at all, even after drawing a new tile, she must place a marker (often little colored plastic trains that come with the game) on their train which allows others to play on her train temporarily until the marker is removed.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of dominoes, the other players add up the value of their remaining tiles.

Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.

This expansion will bring new levels of dread to your table top, with the addition of a brand new Herald Sheet for &quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; &ndash; a powerful and malevolent being that has appeared to prepare the way for the Ancient One, plus more than 200 components and some extraordinary new game mechanics to boot.&#10;&#10;One of the highlights is the full set of 18 Gate markers that are designed to replace those from the Arkham Horror core set, as well as those from The Dunwich Horror and The Kingsport Horror. They are treated exactly the same as the previous Gate markers, except that each Gate now has an additional characteristic. For example, the &quot;Gate of Madness&quot; will cause an investigator to lose one Sanity when they fail to close the Gate, and a &quot;Moving Gate&quot; moves along with monsters during the Mythos phase.&#10; Brand new to The Lurker at the Threshold are Relationship Cards for use in games with two or more players. Each player draws one Relationship Card at the start of the game, which describes some advantage gained due to how the investigator to your left is related to you. Perhaps you are business associates and mutually reap the benefits of income, or both are Students of the Arcane and gain more frequent access to the Spell deck. No matter how you're related, these will bring a more interesting back-story to your game, involving your characters in more ways than ever before.&#10; Finally, The Lurker at the Threshold introduces the Dark Pact deck, which will tempt foolish investigators to enter into a terrible arrangement with the Lurker itself. Although these Dark Pacts may grant your investigator enhanced abilities, there is sure to be a cost. What happens when the price is too high?&#10; Of course, with over 100 new Location cards, Mythos cards, Gate cards and Spells, plus more Common and Unique Items, The Lurker at the Threshold will enhance and expand the enjoyment of Arkham Horror for players of all skill levels.&#10;&#10;-- from the publisher's web site, edited slightly to be up-to-date&#10;&#10;";"Arkham Horror: The Lurker at the Threshold Expansion";2010;8;1;240;240;240;12;"['Adventure', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Novel-based', 'Science Fiction']";"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Daniel Clark (I)', 'Tim Uren']";"['Anders Finér', 'Héctor Ortiz']";"['Edge Entertainment', 'Fantasy Flight Games', 'Galakta', 'Heidelberger Spieleverlag', 'Stratelibri']";2227;7.80333;7740;100;126;606;109;3.3486

0;586;"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards&#10;     304 double-faced .75&quot;, .6&quot;, and .5&quot; counters&#10;     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each&#10;     A plastic card tray&#10;     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O &amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Up Front";1983;2;2;60;60;60;12;"['Card Game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']";"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Hand Management', 'Relative Movement', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Courtney F.

0;16216;"The Discovery is a stand-alone Carcassonne game.&#10;&#10;The inhabitants of Carcassonne have discovered a new region far away from their homeland - one that consists of meadows, mountains and seas. The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.&#10;&#10;This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.&#10;&#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";"Carcassonne: The Discovery";2005;5;2;30;30;30;8;"['Medieval']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Tile Placement']";"['Leo Colovini', 'Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Stefano Mondini', 'Fabio Visintin']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Funagain', 'Hobby World', 'Piatnik', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Smart Ltd', 'Venice Connection']";2203;6.47829;3842;165;62;284;230;1.9304

This continuation of the world's first Unique Deck Game contains 204 new cards seamlessly integrated into a card pool that contains a total of 370 different cards, creating an entirely new collection of Archon Decks for you to discover, explore, and master!&#10;&#10;The KeyForge: Age of Ascension two-player starter provides you with all the tools you need to either begin or expand your adventures on the Crucible, featuring two unique Age of Ascension Archon Decks, a Quickstart Rulebook, two Poster Playmats, and all the keys, tokens, and chain trackers you and your chosen opponent need to start playing!&#10;&#10;In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal!

These opposing forces - the two sides of human nature - struggle to control and shape the Inside World, the metaphorical representation of an evolving personality.&#10; Cerebria introduces a unique theme and numerous innovative mechanisms. The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria&rsquo;s areas, each with their own stats and abilities.&#10;&#10;The Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn. These include moving between Cerebria&rsquo;s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas.

Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board. These are key moments in the game: Cerebria&rsquo;s state is in constant flux, but the Fragments are permanent imprints of a game state during the scoring events.&#10; The game is won by the side with more influence over the finished Identity, thus becoming the dominant force in Cerebria.&#10;&#10;";"Cerebria: The Inside World";2018;4;1;120;60;120;14;"['Fantasy']";"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Richard Amann', 'Viktor Peter', 'István Pócsi', 'Frigyes Schőberl']";"['Pedro A.

At the start of the game he holds unquestioned power across the six nations of the Warsaw Pact. But there are ominous clouds on the horizon. The new leader in Moscow has declared no more will Soviet tanks prop up tottering Communist governments. The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis. Inside the churches and among the students and their professors there are dissident movements that have been emboldened. From crushing dissent to offering concessions, the Communist player will have to use a variety of strategies in a struggle to hold on to his empire.&#10;&#10;&quot;A bad regime is never in so great danger as when it tries to improve.&quot; - Alexis de Tocqueville&#10;&#10;The other player plays the Democrat.

Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.&#10;&#10;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.&#10;&#10;";"Himalaya";2002;4;3;60;60;60;8;"['Economic', 'Medieval', 'Political']";"['Action Queue', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']";"['Régis Bonnessée']";"['Johann Aumaitre', 'David Cochard']";"['Tilsit', '(Web published)', 'Competo / Marektoy']";2160;6.99738;2174;71;183;493;230;2.5739

Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor.

In addition, one or two players are secretly anti-establishment Hippies who are working for nobody. Their goal is to fight the Man and have the fewest points.&#10;&#10;On your turn, offer one of two randomly drawn agent cards to another player. These cards are worth points and have varying good or bad abilities. That player either accepts the agent, in which case they score it, or they refuse, in which case the card returns to you, and you score it. The game ends when a player has five cards, after which the teams are revealed; the team with the highest combined score wins, unless a Hippie has the single lowest score, in which case they win.&#10;&#10;The interactions between the character cards are the spice of the game, but since the abilities are discoverable during play, the game can be taught in three minutes.&#10;&#10;";"Secrets";2017;8;4;35;15;35;10;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Party Game', 'Spies/Secret Agents']";"['Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Take That', 'Team-Based Game']";"['Bruno Faidutti', 'Eric M.

0;152470;"Fief: France 1429 is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.'

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Booty from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Booty 2: Jump the Shark.&#10;&#10;";"Munchkin Booty";2008;6;3;90;90;90;10;"['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Humor', 'Pirates']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Take That', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Steve Jackson (I)']";"['Phil Foglio', 'John Kovalic', 'Tom Siddell']";"['Steve Jackson Games', 'Black Monk', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Raven Distribution', 'Smart Ltd']";2113;6.20966;5231;150;22;211;88;1.9432
0;163413;"Murano the game is set in Murano, a small group of seven islands near Venice that's well-known by tourists for its glassmaking. As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.&#10;&#10;Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.&#10;&#10;Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.&#10;&#10;You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.&#10;&#10;The Complete Edition from 2020 contains Murano: Promo Cards and Murano: The Christmas Tree packaged inside the box and may be found here: Murano: Complete Edition.&#10;&#10;";"Murano";2014;4;2;75;60;75;10;"['City Building', 'Economic']";"['Point to Point Movement', 'Tile Placement']";"['Inka Brand', 'Markus Brand']";"['Klemens Franz']";"['Lookout Games', 'Mayfair Games']";2113;7.19273;2638;95;189;669;111;2.7297

Terra changes the subject matter to general geographic information, includes a brand new Imperial measurements map side (retaining the Metric map side for gamers outside the U.S.), has 300 topics (with three categories of questions) on oversized cards, and simplifies the scoring. Terra plays in 45 minutes for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;(End of publisher's description.)&#10;&#10;Terra is a trivia game with cards that ask three related questions, such as &quot;where was the Woodstock music festival?&quot;, &quot;what year did it take place?&quot; and &quot;how many people attended it?&quot;  A card is selected, and players take turns guessing the answers to the questions by putting tokens on the board in different areas, such as on a map of the world, a time line, or a number line indicating the number of people (as in the example).  Points are scored for correct answers, but some points are also scored for close answers.

0;71021;"In Evolution: The Origin of Species, players do the work of nature, putting animals into play and evolving them trait by trait to help them survive and thrive. Each player starts with a hand of six cards that feature an animal on the back and one or two traits on the front.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of four phases. During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.&#10;&#10;During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.&#10;&#10;During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &quot;feeding&quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.&#10;&#10;During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile. Each player then receives new cards in hand equal to one plus the number of live animals that player has.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the players conduct one final round, then score points. Each live animal is worth 2 VP, and each trait on a live animal worth 1 VP; some traits (Carnivorous and Parasite) provide bonus VPs, but make it tougher to keep an animal alive. The player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;By combining two sets of Evolution, you can have up to eight players in a game.&#10;&#10;";"Evolution: The Origin of Species";2010;4;2;60;30;60;12;"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Dice']";"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Take That']";"['Dmitry Knorre', 'Sergey Machin']";"['Dmitry Knorre']";"['Rightgames RBG SIA', 'G3', 'More Fun Co., Ltd.', 'RBG', 'Stolitsa Design Group', 'TWOPLUS Games', 'ТРЕТЯ ПЛАНЕТА']";2106;6.23838;2747;73;33;222;116;2.0862

Each player has a 4x4 grid, and to complete set up, each player takes four tiles at random, then places them in order from low to high down the diagonal that goes from upper left to lower right.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take either a face-down tile from the pile or a face-up tile from the table. You can (1) place this tile in an empty space in your grid, (2) swap this tile for a tile already in the grid, or (3) discard this tile face-up on the table. However, all tiles in your grid must obey one rule at all times: A tile must be higher in value that any tile directly above it or to its immediate left and lower in value that any tile directly below it or to its immediate right. Whoever first fills their grid with sixteen tiles wins.

Their discovery of Xenium &mdash; a dark, oily compound deep below the planet's surface &mdash; was everything they hoped for. But they found something else, too. The Xenos attack was brutal and unrelenting. While the scientists and soldiers have held them off the best they could, the Xenos are still coming...&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Invader is a cooperative game in which 1-6 players face Xenos, an unfathomable swarm of infected Xenos controlled by the game itself. Each player takes on the role of one to six survivors in a sci-fi setting being overwhelmed by these Xenos. The goal is simple: Choose a mission, complete its objectives, kill as many Xenos as possible, and (most importantly) survive!&#10;&#10;Survivors will fight Xenos, rescue each other, recover vital data, unveil dark secrets, and much more! Survivors can be civilians or soldiers, each with specialized skills. They all play together as a team, trading equipment, and covering each other. They use whatever weapons they can get to kill Xenos and slow the invasion. The better the weapon, the higher the body count, but the more Xenos will appear, attracted by the onslaught! Survivors must also be mindful of their location as conventional weapons work fine indoors, but the planet&rsquo;s oxygen-starved surface, they'll need to arm themselves with more specialized weaponry. Lasers, anyone?&#10;&#10;Most of the time, Xenos are predictable, but there are a lot of them and they use nasty tactics not encountered in previous Zombicide games.

0;22198;"This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.&#10;&#10;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.&#10;&#10;";"Great Wall of China";2006;5;2;30;30;30;10;"['Card Game']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Ted Nasmith', 'Marek Szyszko']";"['Egmont Polska', 'Fantasy Flight Games', '999 Games', 'Devir', 'KOSMOS', 'Laser plus', 'Sophisticated Games']";2099;6.17652;2877;202;40;161;256;1.8516

In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three families and executing one action shown on that card. Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row.&#10;&#10;These actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules. To keep track of that stock, each player has their own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly. Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table.

0;111148;"W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza is, as you might suspect, a dice game in the Bohnanza family. Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect thirteen Bohnentalers wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows six orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!&#10;&#10;";"Würfel Bohnanza";2012;5;2;45;45;45;10;"['Dice', 'Farming']";"['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection']";"['Uwe Rosenberg']";"['Björn Pertoft']";"['999 Games', 'AMIGO']";2078;6.65704;3439;69;75;242;108;1.3148

Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe.

The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game. The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is based around adrenaline, which is the currency that the soldier players use to perform actions. They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario. The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with.&#10;&#10;Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment.&#10;&#10;";"Level 7 [Omega Protocol]";2013;6;2;90;60;90;14;"['Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction']";"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Will Schoonover']";"['Richard Anderson', 'Matt Ferbrache', 'Laine Garrett', 'Adrian Majkrazk', 'Josh Manderville', 'Marco Mazzoni', 'Nestor Ossandon', 'Kevin Prangley', 'Mike Vaillancourt']";"['Privateer Press']";2076;7.45474;4023;158;342;1951;104;3.1538

0;22;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";"Magic Realm";1979;16;1;240;240;240;12;"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']";"['Action Queue', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Modular Board', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Player Elimination', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Role Playing', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Richard Hamblen']";"['George Goebel', 'Kim Grommel', 'Richard Hamblen', 'Randall C.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. They compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. These actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill.&#10;&#10;Your programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own.&#10;&#10;";"Tiny Epic Mechs";2019;4;1;60;30;60;14;"['Fighting', 'Science Fiction']";"['Action Queue', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Programmed Movement', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Scott Almes']";"['Roland MacDonald']";"['Gamelyn Games', 'Angry Lion Games', 'Devir', 'Fishbone Games', 'Pixie Games', 'Reflexshop']";2059;6.80736;8393;200;73;630;37;2.4324

0;30658;"Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age. War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.&#10;&#10;In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre!

As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn. The game ends when an ark has at least ten animals on board.&#10;&#10;Before scoring, all animals in pairs are discarded because a guy called Noah claims all animal pairs for himself.

Yengzuh near Pandala is one of the oldest. The Guild of Extraordinary Traders from Dale promoted the founding of the city after the trade wars in Asia had spread too wide. The city&rsquo;s harbour has tens of great ships all the time, loading and unloading passengers and cargo.&#10;&#10;In Dale of Merchants 2, players take the roles of those participating merchants learning new techniques, trading goods, and managing their stock. The player who first manages to complete their astounding merchant stall wins the game and gets access to the guild!&#10;&#10;Dale of Merchants 2 contains six new decks and can be played by itself or combined with the decks from Dale of Merchants. The game includes a new ruleset for four players that introduces team battle! These new rules greatly enhance the four-player experience by adding cooperation between teammates and cutting downtime. These rules can also be used with the original game's six decks.&#10;&#10;The new decks are:&#10;1)Crocodiles disturb other players&#10;2)Platypuses have more control over cards&#10;3)Polecats have a die&#10;4)Owls are moved to action by things that happen (mostly what other players do)&#10;5)Fennec foxes affect all players&#10;6) Sloths do things at the start of your next turn&#10;&#10;";"Dale of Merchants 2";2016;4;2;30;30;30;10;"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Print & Play']";"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Take That']";"['Sami Laakso']";"['Sami Laakso']";"['Snowdale Design', 'Board Game Leisure', 'Bragelonne Games', 'Devir', 'Fullcap Games', 'Games7Days', 'HOT Games', 'Reflexshop', 'Schwerkraft-Verlag', 'Vendetta']";2041;7.31539;4985;92;113;492;46;2.087

Not only that, the continent is splitting up with parts of the land disappearing and new lands emerging elsewhere.  Players try to disperse as widely as is wise while still dominating each continent where they exist. The game ends as the meteorite strikes, ending the age of the great dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Players begin by placing herds of their dinosaurs on the single continent of Pangea, made from tiles of various terrain types. They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.&#10;&#10;Points are scored during the game whenever a new separate continent is formed as a result of a landscape tile drift, as well as at the end of the game for each continent. During the game, the player with the most herds on the new continent scores 2 points, while the player with the second-most scores 1. End-game scoring is much more significant, as the player with the most herds gains 1 point per landscape tile on the continent, and the player with the second most scores half that amount.&#10;&#10;The final round begins when the meteor strike card is drawn, and the game then ends.

Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own.

Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a teeming metropolis.&#10;&#10;Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon, and politician&mdash;each helping in the development of a hypothetical &quot;Anywhere, USA.&quot; Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game. Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits. These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract. Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.&#10;&#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world&mdash;when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;The grid of streets on the board provides the framework for building the small town. The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area. Each building's value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.&#10;&#10;At the start of a player's turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as &quot;Investments,&quot; gaining Wealth in doing so. Next that player gets 6 &quot;Action Points&quot; (APs) with which to spend on any of the the following activities:&#10;&#10;&bull; Acquiring new Building Permit cards from those available to choose;&#10;&bull; Constructing new buildings from those currently available;&#10;&bull; Acquiring a &quot;Favor&quot;&mdash;a Building Contract that only that player can build.&#10;&#10;Each activity carries with it a variable cost in APs, depending on where the chosen card lies on the board.&#10;&#10;Once a player has spent his APs it's time for a quick reset phase in readiness for the next player's turn. It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige. Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.&#10;&#10;Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts. Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular &quot;zone&quot;&mdash;Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial&mdash;in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office. Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis. Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held&mdash;after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game.&#10;&#10;";"Urban Sprawl";2011;4;2;180;180;180;12;"['City Building', 'Economic']";"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Open Drafting', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement']";"['Chad Jensen']";"['Chad Jensen', 'Rodger B.

0;130960;"Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis). It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.&#10;&#10;The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&quot; blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.&#10;&#10;The  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).&#10;&#10;You can win peacefully by:  &#10;&bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR &#10;&bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).&#10;&#10;If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:&#10;&bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).&#10;&#10;Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.&#10;&#10;Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: &#10;&bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR &#10;&bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR &#10;&bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).&#10;&#10;Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.&#10;&#10;Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.&#10; The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: &#10;&bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and &#10;&bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with&#10;&bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),&#10;&bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some&#10;&bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.&#10;&#10;If  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.&#10;&#10;At  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.&#10;&#10;Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.&#10;&#10;Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).&#10;&#10;Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.&#10;&#10;";"Triumph & Tragedy: European Balance of Power 1936-1945";2015;3;2;360;240;360;12;"['Economic', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Territory Building', 'Wargame', 'World War II']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Movement Points', 'Secret Unit Deployment']";"['Craig Besinque']";"['Charles Kibler', 'Rodger B.

0;269603;"As in the original Minecraft digital game, in Minecraft: Builders &amp; Biomes players explore the Overworld, build structures, and mine resources, earning points for structures and the largest connected biomes of forest, desert, mountain, or snowy tundra spaces on their player boards.&#10;&#10;Familiar foes like Endermen, Creepers, and other mobs also appear throughout the game, and they need to be defeated using weapons collected from the board. Defeating mobs earn players points in addition to granting additional awards. Game scoring occurs as the resource cube's layers are depleted. As soon as the third layer runs out, the adventure comes to an end, and the builder with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you take two different actions from the following possibilities:&#10;&#10;&bull; Collect two blocks: At the start of the game, you set up a 4x4x4 cube of building blocks with 16 wood, 14 sand, 12 stone, 10 obsidian, and 12 emerald being placed together at random. When you collect a block, the top face and at least two other sides must be revealed.&#10;&#10;&bull; Move: Your character starts in the center of a 4x4 grid of tile stacks, with each stack holding four tiles. Weapon tiles are placed at the end of each column and row. Move 0-2 spaces between stacks, then reveal all adjacent tiles that are face down.&#10;&#10;&bull; Build: Discard blocks from your personal supply to match the building requirements on a tile next to your character. Place this tile on your personal 3x3 building board.&#10;&#10;&bull; Fight a mob: Choose a mob adjacent to your character, then reveal three tiles from your weapon stack, which starts with a stone sword, a wooden sword, and three poisonous potatoes. Tally the number of hearts revealed; if this sum is at least as large as the number of hearts on the mob, you defeat it. Remove it from the board, and place it next to your personal building board. Mobs might grant you an endgame scoring bonus, immediate points, or a one-shot bonus action.&#10;&#10;&bull; Collect a weapon: If your character is next to a weapon tile at the edge of the playing grid, you can shuffle it into your weapon stack.&#10;&#10;Scoring takes place three times during the game, specifically after the final block is removed from the first, second, and third level of the building block cube. In the first round, you choose one of the four biomes (forest, desert, mountains, or snowy tundra) and score for the largest connected area of this biome on your personal building board. The board comes pre-printed with biome spaces, and as you place buildings on this board, you can alter the biome of a space. In the second round, you choose one of three materials (wood, sand, stone, or obsidian) and score for the largest connected group of structures on your personal building board that are made of this material. In the third round, you score for the largest contiguous group of structures (decoration, dwelling, animal house, or bridge) of your choice on your board. After scoring in the third round, tally bonus points from the mobs you've collected.&#10;&#10;";"Minecraft: Builders & Biomes";2019;4;2;60;30;60;10;"['Video Game Theme']";"['Action Points', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Movement', 'Layering', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Set-up']";"['Ulrich Blum']";"[]";"['Ravensburger']";2030;7.01817;5071;71;50;495;44;1.9318

0;1038;"Tantrix is a strategy game using painted synthetic resin hexagons (often mistakenly thought to be Bakelite). It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.&#10;&#10;Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).&#10;&#10;The full version contains 56 tiles.&#10;&#10;Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4). Increase the level of difficulty by adding the fifth tile, then 6th tile etc. Comes in Green &amp; Black.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Tantrix Gobble&#10;    The Mind Game&#10;    Kaliko (Psyche-Paths)&#10;&#10;&#10;";"Tantrix";1991;6;1;30;30;30;8;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Puzzle']";"['Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']";"['Mike McManaway']";"['Morgan Andersson', 'Mike McManaway']";"['(Unknown)', 'Coiledspring Games', 'Colour of Strategy, Ltd.', 'Family Games, Inc.', 'Gigamic', 'Grapet', 'Lervik Spill og Leker', 'Mind Games  (II)', 'quecke-verlag', 'Tantrix Games Ibérica, S.

0;205046;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Will you play citizens into your hometown for points, or contribute them to the capital and benefit from their special abilities? In Capital Lux, you always balance on a razor's edge, so will you take risks? Bluff? Or follow a carefully laid plan? The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards. On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital). When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability. Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Merchant: Take 1 gold coin. Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.&#10;    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital. This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.&#10;    Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.&#10;    Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital. If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown. At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points.&#10;&#10;This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players. Since every player is dealt only five or six cards at the beginning of a round, every card play is crucial...&#10;&#10;";"Capital Lux";2016;4;2;30;30;30;10;"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Science Fiction']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management']";"['Eilif Svensson', 'Kristian Amundsen Østby']";"['Kwanchai Moriya']";"['Aporta Games', 'Game Harbor', 'Granna', 'Hobby World', 'Ludicus', 'Morapiaf', 'NeoTroy Games', 'PaperGames (III)', 'Pixie Games']";2020;7.0198;2802;101;110;569;55;1.9636

Ten years later, Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest celebrates the foundations of the original design with a revised and expanded edition that includes all-new art, 40 characters per player, a reputation system to resolve tiebreakers, deluxe loot tokens, a robust solo mode, and much more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";"Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest";2022;6;1;60;45;60;14;"['Fantasy', 'Pirates']";"['Action Queue', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Turn Order: Role Order', 'Variable Phase Order']";"['Paolo Mori']";"['Lamaro Smith']";"['Stonemaier Games', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Delta Vision Publishing', 'Feuerland Spiele', 'Ghenos Games', 'Grok Games', 'Maldito Games', 'Matagot', 'PHALANX', ""Surfin' Meeple""]";2024;7.58636;4826;34;266;1781;65;2.1231
0;136280;"La Boca, the most famous neighborhood in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires, was populated by many Italian immigrants when first founded. The area is best known today for its eccentric skyline, with the houses having been built from scrapped fishing boats and the metal being colorfully painted to create a patchwork effect across the neighborhood.&#10;&#10;Creating skylines of similar beauty and eccentricity is the goal of the construction teams that play La Boca. In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards &ndash; but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer. The faster the players complete their building, the more points they score. Then the next team takes a seat, breaks down the blocks, then begins building anew. Whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds will stand atop La Boca and glory in the cheers of the Argentinian public!&#10;&#10;";"La Boca";2013;6;3;40;40;40;8;"['Abstract Strategy', 'Electronic']";"['Pattern Building', 'Real-Time', 'Square Grid']";"['Inka Brand', 'Markus Brand']";"['Franz Vohwinkel']";"['KOSMOS', 'Asterion Press', 'Competo / Marektoy', 'CreativaMente', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Z-Man Games']";2011;6.97633;2248;45;115;459;90;1.3667
0;199383;"The &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; &mdash; the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth &mdash; was one of the greater guilds of Florence, who arrogated to themselves the civic power of the Republic of Florence during the Late Middle Ages. The woolen cloth trade was the engine that drove the city&rsquo;s economy and the members of the Calimala were the elite of Florence.&#10;&#10;Throughout its long history, the Arte di Calimala supervised the execution of artistic and architectural works. Most Florentine guilds performed such activities, but the Calimala distinguished itself from other guilds through the number and prestige of the projects and the sites administered, including the construction and decoration of some of the major churches of the city.&#10;&#10;Players of Calimala are cloth merchants in medieval Florence, with a number of trusted employees that they assign to various streets within the city to carry out actions. (Each street connects two places where particular actions can be taken.) While taking these actions, players produce and deliver cloth and contribute to the construction and decoration of various buildings across the city. Employees stay on their assigned places for a while, carrying out their actions whenever the street is activated, and eventually are promoted into the city council, triggering a scoring phase.&#10;&#10;Depending on the number of players, each player has a number of action discs. In turn order, they can put one on a space between two actions, performing both actions and activating all other discs on the same space. When the fourth disc is placed on an action space, the lowest one is promoted to the city council, which triggers a scoring. After the last action disc is placed or the last scoring phase in the council is triggered, the game ends. The positions of the action spaces and sequence of scoring phases vary from game to game, making each game very different. Secret scoring objectives and action cards add uncertainty.&#10;&#10;";"Calimala";2017;5;3;75;75;75;10;"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Medieval', 'Renaissance', 'Transportation', 'Travel']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Modular Board', 'Order Counters', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement']";"['Fabio Lopiano']";"['Harald Lieske']";"['ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH', 'Arrakis Games', 'Rightgames RBG SIA', 'Stronghold Games']";2011;7.18494;2414;84;201;751;60;2.8167

These states were finally unified in 221 BCE&nbsp;under the Qin dynasty to lay the origin of today's China, with its two main rivers: the Yellow and the Yangtze.&#10;&#10;Yellow &amp; Yangtze, the sister game to the highly acclaimed board game Tigris &amp; Euphrates, invites you to replay this eventful period and to lead your dynasty to victory.&#10;&#10;In Yellow &amp; Yangtze, players build civilizations through tile placement. Players are given five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category. Conflicts arise when civilizations connect on the board. To succeed, players' civilizations must survive these conflicts, calm peasant revolts, and grow secure enough to build prestigious pagodas.&#10;&#10;";"Yellow & Yangtze";2018;4;2;90;90;90;14;"['Ancient', 'Civilization', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']";"['Reiner Knizia']";"['Vincent Dutrait']";"['Grail Games', '17wanzy (Yihu BG)', 'Lavka Games', 'Maldito Games', 'Matagot', 'sternenschimmermeer']";2010;7.86509;3069;39;447;1548;74;3.1351
