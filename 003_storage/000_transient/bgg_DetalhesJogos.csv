0;30549;"In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;";"Pandemic";2008;4;2;45;45;45;8;"['Medical']";"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']";"['Matt Leacock']";"['Josh Cappel', 'Christian Hanisch', 'Régis Moulun', 'Chris Quilliams', 'Tom Thiel']";"['Z-Man Games', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment', 'Albi', 'Asmodee', 'Asmodee Italia', 'Asterion Press', 'Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)', 'Boardgame Space', 'Brain Games', 'Devir', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Galápagos Jogos', 'Gém Klub Kft.', 'HaKubia', 'Hobby Japan', 'HomoLudicus', 'Jolly Thinkers', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lacerta', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd', 'MINDOK', 'Nordic Games GmbH', 'Paladium Games', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Quined White Goblin Games', 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.', 'Siam Board Games', 'Stratelibri', 'Wargames Club Publishing', 'White Goblin Games', 'Zhiyanjia', 'Ігромаг', 'Взрослые дети']";114420;7.56843;179197;2767;609;9590;5758;2.405
0;822;"Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";"Carcassonne";2000;5;2;45;30;45;7;"['City Building', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']";"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Map Addition', 'Tile Placement']";"['Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Marcel Gröber', 'Doris Matthäus', 'Anne Pätzke', 'Chris Quilliams', 'Franz-Georg Stämmele', 'Klaus-Jürgen Wrede']";"['Hans im Glück', '999 Games', 'Albi', 'Bard Centrum Gier', 'Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)', 'Brain Games', 'cutia.ro', 'Devir', 'Fantasmagoria', 'Filosofia Éditions', 'Giochi Uniti', 'Grow Jogos e Brinquedos', 'Hobby World', 'Ísöld ehf.', 'Kaissa Chess & Games', 'Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.', 'Lautapelit.fi', 'Midgaard Games', 'MINDOK', 'Möbius Games', 'Monkey Time', 'NeoTroy Games', 'Nordic Games ehf', 'Paper Iyagi', 'Piatnik', 'Ponva d.o.o.', 'Rio Grande Games', 'Schmidt Spiele', 'Smart Ltd', 'Stupor Mundi', 'SuperHeated Neurons', 'Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.', 'Venice Connection', 'Ventura Games', 'Z-Man Games']";114328;7.41461;170801;1824;648;7877;7870;1.902
